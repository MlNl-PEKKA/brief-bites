                            "summary": "The ongoing legal proceedings pertaining to the petitions seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriage in India have left the entire nation in a state of anticipation. Today was the first day of the hearing before a Constitution bench comprising CJI DY Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Justice Ravindra Bhat, Justice Hima Kohli, and Justice PS Narasimha. The day saw arguments ranging from equality of the laws, privacy and dignity of the members of the LGBTQIA++ community, and the rights concurrent to marriage equality, among others. However, what was of pertinence was the ambit or canvas of arguments which the Court decided to hear in the upcoming days. At the very outset, upon questions being raised by the Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Central Government, on the maintainability of the petitions, the court clarified that for now, it would be limiting itself to the ambit of the Special Marriage Act and would steer clear of personal laws.Centre Questions Maintainability of Petitions, Seeks to Implead StatesBefore delving deeper into the bench's discussion on whether it would deal with marriage equality in personal laws or not, it is important to take note of SG Tushar Mehta's arguments on maintainability. SG Mehta argued that the subject the court was dealing with was creation of a socio-legal relationship of marriage and the same was the domain of the competent legislature. He added that if the court still decides to hear the matter, it should implead all States as parties in the matter. He said–When the subject is in the concurrent list, we cannot rule out the possibility of one state agreeing to it and another state being against it. In case of states not being joined, the petitions wouldn't be maintainable. The debate which is to happen to conferring or creation of socio-legal institution - should that be the forum of this court or parliament?The court was not inclined to quash the petitions on the ground of maintainability with CJI DY Chandrachud interjecting the SG and stating that the nature of the SG's preliminary objection depended upon the canvas the petitioners opened up. He said–Once we have a picture on what is the canvas they're arguing on, we may tell them what is the canvas we want them to argue on.Per contra, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended that the SG's submissions did not hinge the maintainability of the petitions under Article 32. He added–I have a right to approach this court. I have a right to be heard. My grievance may be right or wrong, your lordships will decide upon that but we are persons who are of the same sex. We have, according to us, the same rights under the Constitution as the heterosexual group of the society. Your lordships have held that. The only stumbling block on our equal rights was 377. That is now gone. Criminality is now gone. The unnatural part or order of nature is gone from our statute. So therefore our rights are equal.He also added that the right to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 was itself a fundamental right.Post broad submissions by Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, the bench noted that it had understood the canvas of the matter and had decided that it could steer clear of personal laws. CJI DY Chandrachud orally remarked–Now that we've understood broadly the canvas of the matter, we can at this stage, steer clear of personal law. It may not be necessary for the court to then get into personal law.Can we deal with questions pertaining to Special Marriage Act now and leave personal laws for a better time? Asks Supreme CourtSenior Advocate Menaka Guruswamy, representing a petitioner who had sought an expansive reading of the Hindu Marriage Act to include queer marriages within its ambit stated–The Hindu Marriage Act is not an issue necessarily of personal law. It is a statutory law. We will demonstrate that. The origin of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu code, did something that was not permitted in sacramental Hindu Law, which is, inter caste marriages, Sagothra marriages, inheritance...However, the bench did not seem eager to entertain arguments on marriage equality in Hindu Marriage Act at this juncture. CJI DY Chandrachud orally remarked–There may be some amount of sage wisdom in also going about our tasks in incremental manner. Because otherwise do we then confine ourselves only to Hindu Marriage Act? What about the Parsis, Jews, Muslims- there are a lot of communities. The Constitution itself and the law itself is evolving so the court has to be mindful that we're moving by process of interpretation. Perhaps, going incrementally, cover a canvas for the present, confine yourself to this canvas, and then allow parliament's perception to evolve with time. Because parliament is also responding to the evolution of society. We can't deny the fact that there is undoubtedly the legislative element also involved.Justice SK Kaul supported the opinion of the Chief Justice and added–Sometimes incremental changes in issues of societal ramifications are better. There is time for everything. Therefore what was being suggested was- can we, for the time being, confine it only to limited issue, don't step into personal law issues. You can assist on how we can develop the notion of a civil union which finds recognition in our statute - the Special Marriage Act?To this, Guruswamy responded that marriage was not only a question of dignity but also a bouquet of rights that LGBTQ people are being denied post (Navtej Singh) Johar. While highlighting the rights marriage ensured to a person, she said that if the community is granted anything less of the right of marriage, individual members of the queer community will have to come and litigate on individual issues. She said–Bank account, life insurance, medical insurance...I cannot buy SCBA medical insurance. This is the reality of how rights are exercised. Rights are exercised when you're able to protect your relationships. One facet of that right is the constitutional value of dignity, equality, fraternity. The other facet is the day-to-day business of life. When we look at law in India, most rights flow from this notion of blood relationships, i.e., either being born into a family or being married. That is the problem. If it is short of full marriage, it will mean that subsequently, not just Mr Rohatgi, but Mr Kirpal, me, we will keep coming back to court to litigate individual issues of discrimination. I am not able to nominate my partner for life insurance. These are not theoretical issues. This is our life. This is why we say marriage. Because that is the notion that the legal framework which is premised on common law understands and takes within its fold. So anything short - if it is a civil union, this correspondence will now start with insurance company, with banks, with hospitals, with wills, with estate duties, with anything that is pre requisite to be able to live a life outside a home, including buying that home.However, Justice Kaul still did not seem satisfied and stated that even in the judgement in Puttaswamy, the court did find that there were nuances that came up later. He added–It may require more visits to court. We can't say. But we cannot say that it'll be possible to work out all possible nuances now. If you say you don't want to touch personal law, then the argument is limited. So can we in SMA, read person and leave everything else for a better time?The hearing will necessarily affect personal laws: SG MehtaUpon court's insistence to not delve into the ambit of personal laws as of yet, SG Mehta argued that whether the court liked it or not the hearings would necessarily affects personal laws. Rebutting Dr Guruswamy's submission, he submitted that Hindu marriage Act was a codified personal law and even other religions such as Islam had personal laws. Justice Kaul interrupted his arguments and said–We're not getting into the personal laws.SG Mehta still insisted upon his point and said–That's not the point. Somebody who is not Hindu can come here and say why did you not give me the same treatment, I want to be Hindu, I want to marry under HMA...Your lordships will have Hindus, Muslims- everyone will be affected. Therefore the central government very respectfully prays that states will have to be heard.However, the bench refused to hear arguments on personal laws and asked the SG to confine his submissions to the discussion ongoing in court. Justice Kaul said–We're saying we're not going into the broader canvas. We're unwilling to go into personal laws. Therefore, they have agreed for the time being to argue on aspects which we're considering.SG Mehta still continued his argument on personal laws to persuade the bench and said–Today your lordships may not go into personal law but the window of personal law will open. Entry 5, concurrent law is agnostic. It's the law of marriage. It's not Hindu, Muslim or Parsi. So I'm reiterating that my preliminary objection be taken first and you may issue notice to states.The CJI then stated that the bench will reflect upon the same."

                            "summary": "The Supreme Court bench hearing petitions seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages Tuesday said it will steer clear of the area of personal laws but will only examine if the right can be conferred under The Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954. Crucially, in response to an argument that the “legislative intent” of marriage throughout has been a “relationship between a biological man and a biological female”, the apex court underlined that “there is no absolute concept” of a man or woman.A five-judge Constitution bench, presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, said it will restrict itself to the SMA and not broaden the canvas. The bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul, Ravindra Bhat, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha, said it is better to proceed incrementally than to try and deal with it all together.“Sometimes incremental changes in issues of societal ramifications are better. There is time for everything. Therefore, what was being suggested was, can we for the time being confine only to limited issue, and not step into personal law issues,” said Justice Kaul.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, urged the court to first consider the government’s objections to the maintainability of the petitions. He said the subject involves the creation of a socio-legal relationship of marriage which is the domain of the competent legislature.Mehta also said it was important that states be heard on the issue. He said that since the subject is on the concurrent list, one cannot rule out the possibility of a state agreeing to it and another being against it. He argued that the petitions would not be maintainable if states are not joined.The CJI said that what the SG was trying to raise in the form of a preliminary objection is a response to the merits of the petition, but Mehta denied this.Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for some of the petitioners, said what the SG argued did not hinge on the maintainability of a writ petition by an individual who complains that his fundamental rights are being restricted. “I have a right to approach this court”. He said homosexuals have the same rights under the Constitution as heterosexual groups of society.AdvertisementRohatgi said that the only stumbling block to their equal rights was IPC Section 377 which was struck down. “Criminality is now gone. The unnatural part or order of nature is gone from our statute. So, therefore, our rights are equal”, he argued, adding that “if our rights are identical…, then we want to enjoy the full extent of our rights under (articles) 14, 15, 19 and 21.”He contended that there is still stigma attached to homosexual relations which can be done away only with a declaration by the Supreme Court. “We want privacy in our homes and not face stigma in public places. So we desire the same institution between two people as is available to others – the concept of marriage and family. Because marriage and family are respected in our society,” he said.Once the court declares that we can register our marriages under SMA, “society will accept us. The stigma will only go once the state recognises it. That will be full and final assimilation,” he said.AdvertisementThe CJI said that “between (the SC’s ruling in) Navtej Johar (wherein Section 377 was held unconstitutional) and today, our society has found much greater acceptance of same-sex couples. That’s very positive because you find that there is a greater acceptance in our Universities”. He added that “in this evolving consensus, the court is also playing a dialogical role to create that consensus and move towards an equal future”.Senior Advocate Menaka Guruswamy said marriage is not only a question of dignity but also carried with it a bouquet of rights that the LGBTQ community is denied post Navtej Johar, for eg, those pertaining to bank account, life insurance, medical insurance. “I cannot buy Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) medical insurance”.Guruswamy said that any relief short of full marriage would mean that the LGBTQ community will have to keep coming back to court to litigate individual issues of discrimination.Justice Kaul, however, said that even in the Puttaswamy case wherein privacy was held as a fundamental right, “we found that there were nuances that come up later. It may require more visits to court. We can’t say. But we cannot say that it will be possible to work out all possible nuances now”.Mehta said acceptance of any relation in society is not dependent on either legislation or judgment. “It comes only from within.” He added that “the legislative intent of the legislature throughout has been a relationship between a biological male and a biological female, including SMA.”AdvertisementDisagreeing, the CJI said “there is a very important value judgment that you are making – that the very notion of a biological man is absolute or that notion of a biological woman is also absolute which is incorrect. There is no absolute concept of a man or absolute concept of a woman at all. Biological man is not a definition of what your genitals are… It’s far more complex… So even when the SMA says man and woman, the very notion of a man and notion of a woman is not an absolute based on what genitals you have.”The SG said that “for man, irrespective of other attributes than the genitals, there are age limits prescribed. The court will have to examine whether marriage is a fundamental right, right to marry de hors the law is a fundamental right.”AdvertisementHe added that if the notion the CJI referred to is treated to be a guiding factor to decide whether one is a man or a woman, the court will unintentionally be making several acts unworkable. “I may have the genitals of a man, but is otherwise a female as is possibly being suggested, then how would I be treated under CrPC. As a woman can I be called, for giving a statement after a particular time… I may say this is only a notion (that I am a man). I may have the genitals of a man but now I am a woman. There are several issues which have to be gone into, better Parliament go into it.”"

                            "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday confined the examination of the plea seeking legal recognition of same sex marriage tom the Special Marriage Act without in any way infringing upon different personal laws of the Hindus, Muslims and the others.Limiting the scope of the issue to the Special Marriage Act without touching upon other consequential issues including adoption, a five-judge constitution bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha said, “It cannot decide everything before deciding anything” leaving other issues to follow in due course of time for their resolution.The entire issue got narrowed down to the Special Marriage Act as senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for one of the petitioners seeking legal recognition of same sex marriage told the court that they were seeking this declaration in favour of same sex marriage independent of Hindu personal law, under the Special Marriage Act.The daylong hearing saw Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre telling the constitution bench to leave the issue to be dealt by the legislature. He sought issuance of notice to the States to seek their response on the contentious issue – a plea that was opposed by the lawyers appearing for the different petitioners who argued that issue involves fonduta rights of persons seeking legal sanction of same sex marriage.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for a petitioner seeking legal sanction to same sex marriage said that consequential issues involves so many facets that mere recognition of same sex marriage cannot be left to be an empty shell.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for a Muslim organisation said that though personally he was in favour of the issue but it involves may complexities like in the event of a breakdown of the same sex marriage who will be the father and who will be projected as wife for the purposes of criminal code.Sibal told the court that since it (court) has limited the ambit of issue to the Special Marriage Act, he is out of the case as he was to argue on the basis of Muslim personal law. However, the bench asked him to assist the court in the matter at a later stage.Another senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi cautioned the court that even if it decides the issue by limiting it to Special Marriage Act, the such a same sex couple would be at the window of other consequential reliefs.The court is seized of a batch of petitions relating to the issue of same sex marriage, challenging the denial of the access to the to the institution of marriage to the members of the LGBTQ+ community as being in contravention of Part III of the Constitution, including Articles 14,15,19 and 21."

                            "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that there is no absolute concept of man or a woman and it cannot be only about the genitals, rather it is far more complex.The top court, while going ahead with hearing a batch of petitions seeking legal recognition to same-sex marriage, also said it would not step into personal laws but restrict it to the Special Marriage Act to give it gender neutral interpretation by evolving civil union relationship.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before a five-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud that there is a legislative intent that a marriage can only happen between a biological man and a biological woman under the laws including in the Special Marriage Act.Also Read | Will not go into personal laws, says SC while hearing pleas for legal validation for same-sex marriagesThe CJI, however, said told Mehta orally, “You are making very important judgement. That very notion of a biological man is absolute and the notion of biological woman is also absolute”.Mehta said a biological man is a biological man and it is not a notion.“There is no absolute concept of a man or a woman at all, it cannot be the definition of what your genitals are, it is far more complex. Even when the Special Marriage Act says man and woman, the very notion of a man and notion of a woman is not an absolute, based on what genitals you have,” the bench said in oral observation.At the outset, Mehta insisted that his preliminary objections against the maintainability of the petitions seeking same-sex marriage should be decided first.He said all States should be issued notices before a decision is made by the top court.Mehta submitted that the institution of marriage affects personal laws, Hindu Marriage Act is a codified personal law and Islam has their own personal law, and part of them is not codified.However, the bench, also comprising justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, S Ravindra Bhat, Hima Kohli, and P S Narasimha, said that it is not getting into personal laws.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing one of the petitioners seeking recognition of same-sex marriage, submitted that his clients seek a declaration that “we have a right to get married”.A counsel said that right will be recognised by the state as under the Special Marriage Act and the marriage will be recognised by the State after declaration of this court.Rohatgi contended that this is because even now we are stigmatised, and this is even after IPC Section 377 judgement in Navtej Singh Johar case.The counsel said that the Special Marriage Act should mention 'spouse' instead of man and women.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing of one the parties in the matter opposing same-sex marriages, contended that marriage between man and woman is not a gift of law, but existed since time immemorial and marriages are necessary to perpetuate the human race itself.He contended that even SMA has provisions reflective of personal laws and talks about different marriageable age for a man and a woman.How would one reconcile with these (who is man and who is woman), he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for some Muslims organisation, submitted that he is all for such relationships but is concerned about the serious societal consequences, which may follow after declaration.What happens if they adopt a child and later want to separate? Who gets maintenance, he asked.Sibal stressed that if piecemeal arrangement is done then it will create more complications, which will hurt the community and in other countries where same-sex marriages were recognised, they overhauled the entire legal framework.The petitioners questioned validity of certain provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Foreign Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act and other laws on the ground that they denied same sex couples the right to marry."

                            "summary": "A day after he joined the Congress, former Karnataka Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar on Tuesday minced no words as he hit out at BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh, alleging that those loyal to him were promoted at the expense of many senior leaders.Shettar said the BJP would face defeat even though Santhosh was able to execute his “game plan”. “There is a saying in the party (BJP), that the party is more important than any individual. However, (these days) loyalty to a person is more important than loyalty to the party. Those loyal to him were given priority,” said the former CM, who was a six-time BJP MLA.The ruling party has fielded Mahesh Tenginakayi from Hubli-Dharwad Central, whom Shettar called Santhosh’s “Manasa Putra (blue-eyed boy)”. Said the former CM, “Because of Santhosh’s commitment, he got the ticket.” In 2018, Tenginakayi had to withdraw his nomination from Kalghatgi constituency in Dharwad due to public opposition, said Shettar. Eventually, C M Nimbannavar won on a BJP ticket.The former CM alleged that Santhosh had plans to not field other senior leaders such as Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and S Suresh Kumar. But, fearing blowback over dropping several candidates, the central BJP leader was not able to execute it. Shettar claimed that in Mysuru former minister S A Ramdas was denied a ticket and T S Srivatsa who is close to Santhosh was nominated.Responding to the allegations, Tenginakayi said, “Santhoshji is a Sangh pracharak and working without any desires or aspirations. He does not pick and choose. Any one person cannot take such decisions in the party. Decisions are made by the BJP Parliamentary Board.”Must Read | BJP walks caste tightrope in Karnataka ticket allocation, tries to pacify groups unhappy about quota changesShettar’s allegations have put Santhosh back in the spotlight like in the past few elections. Santhosh and former Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa are known to have been involved in a feud when the former was the BJP general secretary (organisation) of the state unit. The differences between the two camps often came to the fore during the distribution of election tickets. According to party insiders, there has been speculation in the past about Santosh harbouring chief ministerial ambitions and cultivating his coterie of supporters in each district.In the past few years, as Yediyurappa’s influence over the state unit loosened, Santhosh, who hails from Karnataka, tried to assert himself. In the last few elections, such as the Rajya Sabha polls in 2020, Santhosh gained an upper hand as he secured tickets for candidates selected by him, much to the chagrin of some state leaders. For the coming polls too, Santhosh has succeeded in ensuring tickets to several of his loyalists.AdvertisementThough the list of candidates shows that Yediyurappa still continues to have his say in the affairs of the state unit, insiders say that the control of the state BJP office is now firmly in Santhosh’s hands. Shettar on Tuesday made this point, noting that BJP vice president Nirmal Kumar Surana whom Yediyurappa expelled in 2017 was reinstated two years later.Santhosh has been active in the run-up to the May 10 elections, holding meetings with the cadre of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in several parts of the state. Amid speculation that Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah of the Congress could contest from Kolar, he shifted his focus to the constituency and is learnt to have held strategy meetings. In the end, the Congress fielded Siddaramaiah from Varuna in Mysuru district and nominated Kothur G Manjunath from Kolar.Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru that it was Santhosh’s ploy to field minister V Somanna against him even though the Govindrajnagar MLA was not keen on contesting from Varuna."

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 03:01 pm | Updated 03:54 pm IST - BelagaviFormer Karnataka CM Jagadish Shettar, who quit the BJP to join the Congress, believes that he was denied the ticket to contest the Assembly elections by the machinations of party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh, who wanted to groom his supporters.“Mr Santosh saw to it that I did not get the BJP ticket, which went to his loyalist Mahesh Tenginakai instead. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told me that they were in my favour, but did not try hard enough,’‘ he told journalists in his home in Hubballi on April 18.In 2004, after Vijay Sankeshwar resigned from the party, Mr Shettar got a request from late Arun Jaitley, who was then handling Karnataka for the BJP, to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Dharwad. “But, I declined, as I was not interested in national politics. I suggested the name of Pralhad Joshi. I have campaigned harder for Mr Joshi than I have for myself. Now, I only ask Mr Joshi to recall this,’‘ he said.Asked if he would contest as a Congress candidate against Mr Joshi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mr Shettar said he would consider the possibility at the appropriate time.Coming back to Mr Santosh, he said, “Mr Santosh has been in charge of elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal. But he has not succeeded anywhere. I do not understand why the BJP high command trusts him so much with elections in Karnataka, or elsewhere.”BJP claims that party is more important than individuals, but is it?“BJP’s long-held motto has been that the party is more important than any individual. But with his consistent and well-planned actions, Mr Santosh has proved this is not true. Now, Karnataka BJP is in the clutches of a few persons whose writ runs in the party. There is no democratic decision-making in the party any more,’‘ Mr Shettar claimed.“However, mine is not an isolated case. Mr Santosh has been grooming an army of loyalists across Karnataka. He has toppled senior leaders, who had remained loyal to the BJP for decades, only to accommodate his favourites. Long-time leaders, who built the party with hard work, are being shown the door, only to be replaced by ‘yes men’. Even the BJP State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel is his man. Mr Santosh brought Mr Kateel into the core committee, and now, he has been continuing in his position (State unit president) even though his term is over. All this is only because he (Mr Kateel) obeys Mr Santosh. This will lead to weakening of the BJP’s base, and ultimate destruction of the party,’‘ Mr Shettar said.Misinformation campaign to weaken the case of sitting BJP MLAs“Mr Santosh has interfered in ticket distribution in several districts. He has been directing his followers in some constituencies to launch a misinformation campaign against popular leaders. In Hubballi, such a whisper campaign has been going on against me for 6-7 months. Some BJP workers were going around spreading rumours that I was not going to get the ticket this time, and that the decision had been taken by the BJP high command a long time ago. When I came to know of this campaign, I was surprised. How can the party deny the ticket to a six-time MLA who is also a former CM? I brought this to the notice of leaders like (Union Minister) Dharmendra Pradhan in the core committee meeting. But they did not take it seriously,” Mr Shettar said.“In Mysuru, Mr Santosh ensured that his loyalist Sri Vatsa got the ticket instead of S.A. Ramadas, MLA of Krishnaraja. Earlier, Mr Santosh had used another leader, H.V. Rajiv, to speak against Mr Ramadas openly. But the ticket went to Mr Sri Vatsa, and not Mr Rajiv. Some time ago, former minister (and Rajajinagar MLA) S. Suresh Kumar told me about a whisper campaign against him in his constituency.“Young and inexperienced leaders like former IPS officer Annamalai have been made joint in-charge of Karnataka while senior leaders like me are not consulted. That is only because Mr Annamalai is a loyalist of Mr Santosh.”Denial of ticket was not the only reason to leave BJPA visibly upset Mr Shettar reiterated that he was humiliated by the BJP leadership repeatedly.“It may seem that I am upset only because I was denied the ticket. That is not true. I was sidelined. My seniority was not respected, and I was thrown out of the party I built, without basic courtesy. But I kept quiet, as I had high regard for the party. But when they denied me a ticket without informing me beforehand, I could not take it any longer. It was as if the flood gates had opened,” he said.“I would have accepted if the party leaders had invited me to Delhi and intimated me of their decision to drop me. But that was not done. Some person called me on April 11, two days before beginning of filing of nominations and told me that I was not getting the ticket, and that I had to sign a printed form declaring that I had accepted the party’s decision. That was very insulting. I decided to change parties, to retain my self-respect. The only condition I have laid before the Congress is that I should be treated with the respect that I deserve.“Earlier, when leaders like (Union Ministers) Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in charge of Karnataka, they consulted us extensively. We were not consulted by the new dispensation for any important decisions. In the last three years, I was not allowed to speak even for five minutes in the BJP State executive committee, of which I am a long-standing member.”Not scared of I-T raid or EDHe is neither afraid of nor bothered about raids by the income tax department or the Enforcement Directorate. “My life is an open book. There are no dark spots in my 30-year political career. I do not own or run any illegal business. I am not an extremely wealthy man. I only have some limited assets that were created through legal means. Even if the I-T or ED officers raid them, they will not find anything amiss,” the former CM said.There is no confusion in his mind about his ideological suitability in the Congress. “I like to think about it like this — both are national parties that want to work for the poor and marginalised. I have always led a life of probity. I have always had people’s welfare on the top of my mind. I will continue to do that in this party,’‘ he said.CM confident that Jagadish Shettar’s exit will not push Lingayats away from BJPChief Minister Basavaraj Bommai denied the allegation that Mr Santosh had prevented Mr Shettar from getting the BJP ticket, or that the party is in the clutches of a clique.“The party high command is following some principles in the distribution of tickets. There are systems in place. It is a very open and democratic system. Our topmost leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a highly democratic leader,’‘ he told journalists in Mudhol in Bagalkot district.“Mr Shettar is complaining about centralisation of power, but was a centre of power till recently,” he said.The CM does not expect the exit of Mr Shettar or Laxman Savadi to alter the party’s Lingayat base. “Lingayats in Karnataka are vigilant. They take the right decision about various issues. The Congress, had tried to divide the Lingayat community, but is now showing unprecedented love for them. That is nothing, but opportunism,’‘ he said. “The BJP will win a majority of seats in northern Karnataka despite the exit of some leaders.”"

Siddaramaiah also blamed the government for not taking action to rescue them.Hakki Pikkis in Sudan are left stranded without food since the last few days and the government is yet to initiate action to bring them back. @BJP4India government should immediately open diplomatic discussions and reach out to international agencies to ensure the well-being of Hakki Pikkis, he said on Twitter.It is reported that 31 people from Karnataka belonging to Hakki Pikki tribe, are stranded in Sudan which is troubled by civil war. I urge @PMOIndia @narendramodi, @HMOIndia, @MEAIndia and @BSBommai to immediately intervene and ensure their safe return, he added.Jaishankar asked him not to politicise the incident and highlighted the efforts taken by the government in Sudan.Simply appalled at your tweet! There are lives at stake; don’t do politics.Since the fighting started on April 14th, the Embassy of India in Khartoum has been continuously in touch with most Indian Nationals and PIOs in Sudan, Jaishankar said in a tweet.Their details and locations cannot be made public for security reasons. Their movement is constrained by fierce fighting that is ongoing. Plans regarding them have to take into account a very complicated security scenario. The embassy is in constant touch with the ministry in that regard. It is grossly irresponsible of you to politicize their situation.

I wanted to provide a better life for my children, which is why we came to Sudan,” said Prabhu S, from Karnataka’s Hakki Pikki tribe, who is among several Indian nationals stuck in violence-hit Sudan.Fierce fighting has erupted since Saturday between the military and the country’s paramilitary force in Khartoum, where at least 31 tribals from Karnataka are stuck.Prabhu (36), from Davangere district, and his wife Soniya (27) left India 10 months ago, while their four children – two boys aged 5 and 8 and two girls aged 10 and 14 – stayed back.Speaking to The Indian Express over the phone, he said: “From my father, we inherited 4.5 acres, but it was taken away from the government, which said it was forest land. My ancestors hunted and caught birds; we did not get any education. We thought of coming to Sudan so we can grow financially.”The couple sell ayurvedic products, for which they say demand in Sudan, and Africa in general, is high.Anil Kumar, another tribal man who runs a similar business, said, “Our tribe has continued to be neglected, and we have no choice but to go to African countries for a living.”Prabhu said: “With no job in India, my loans crossed Rs 10 lakh. That was when we decided to work in African countries for five years. We took a Rs 3 lakh loan to buy air tickets and to transport materials to Sudan.”AdvertisementAlso Read | Indians in Sudan’s Khartoum asked to stay indoors amid clashes between paramilitary and army“In a day, we could earn Rs 2,000- Rs 3,000. Despite the high cost of living, there is demand for Indian ayurvedic medicines here. When it comes to expenditure, we have to pay Rs 81 for 1.5 litres of water,” he said.Prabhu said the bombings and firing continued on Tuesday as well.Meanwhile, External Affairs minister S Jaishankar and former Karnataka Chief minister K Siddaramaiah got into a Twitter spat, as the Congress leader urged the Central government to immediately intervene and ensure safe return of the group from the Hakki Pikki tribe.AdvertisementSiddaramaiah tweeted, “It is reported that 31 people from Karnataka belonging to Hakki Pikki tribe, are stranded in Sudan which is troubled by civil war.

BJP govt should immediately open diplomatic discussions & reach out to international agencies to ensure the well-being of Hakki Pikkis,” he said on Twitter. “It is also unfortunate to know that we have lost one Indian & 60 others in the ongoing civil war in Sudan. My deepest condolences to their families and pray for the peace in the region,” the Congress leader, who is leading the election campaign ahead of the Assembly elections in Karnataka, said.Responding sharply, Jaishankar said, “Simply appalled at your tweet! There are lives at stake; don’t do politics. Since the fighting started on April 14th, the Embassy of India in Khartoum has been continuously in touch with most Indian Nationals and PIOs in Sudan.”Simply appalled at your tweet!

We sincerely request all fellow Indians to continue to stay where they are and not venture outside,” the mission had said in its second advisory after violence broke out in Khartoum."

                            "summary": "Yogi Adityanath's remarks came in the wake of the shocking murders of Atiq Ahmed and his brotherNo mafia or criminal can threaten industrialists in Uttar Pradesh anymore, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said today, days after the shocking murders of gangster Atiq Ahmed and his brother prompted a wave of criticism over the state's law and order situation.The Chief Minister was addressing an event to mark the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for setting up textile parks in Lucknow and Hardoi districts. The textile parks are being set up under the PM Mega Integrated Textiles and Apparel (PM Mitra) scheme.Now, a professional criminal or a mafia cannot threaten an industrialist over the phone, he said as the audience broke into a round of applause.Uttar Pradesh was notorious for riots. Just the names of many districts scared people. Now there is no need to be scared, the Chief Minister said.Taking a swipe at the previous Akhilesh Yadav-led government, Mr Adityanath said the state witnessed more than 700 riots between 2012 and 2017. But not a single riot broke out in UP between 2017 and 2023, no curfew was imposed. That situation did not arise. And this is the most conducive opportunity to invest and set up industries, he said.Mr Adityanath said Uttar Pradesh now guarantees effective law and order arrangements.The Chief Minister's remarks came in the aftermath of the shocking murders of Atiq Ahmed and brother Ashraf outside a Prayagraj hospital Saturday night. The two accused in the February 24 Umesh Pal murder case had been brought to the hospital for a medical check-up when three shooters rained bullets on them, killing them on the spot.The murders, which took place while the two were accompanied by a police team, have triggered strong remarks on the state's law and order situation. Questions on glaring lapses in police's preparations and response have come to the fore.Main opposition Samajwadi Party has hit out at the state government over the murders that took place on live TV as Atiq was addressing the press.Crime has reached its peak in UP and the morale of the criminals is high. When someone can be killed openly despite being surrounded by a security cordon, one can imagine the state of the general public. Due to this (alleged encounter killings), an ambience of fear is being created among the public. It seems that some people are deliberately creating such an ambience, Akhilesh Yadav, Leader of Opposition in Assembly and chief of Samajwadi Party, tweeted.Amid the criticism, the state government has ordered a high-level probe into the murders. UP police, too, have formed a three-member Special Investigation Team to look into the incident.The matter has also reached the Supreme Court. The court today decided to hear a petition seeking an independent probe into the killings of the gangster and his brother. The petitioner has also urged the court to look into the growing trend of encounter killings by UP police. Such actions by police are a severe threat to democracy and rule of law and lead to a police state, the petition has stated."

                            "summary": "KANPUR The precision with which the three shooters cut into the security cordon and took out Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf can only come with rigorous practise, say experts. The way the three accused handled the firearms and executed the operation with near perfection also showed their skill, they added. Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf were shot dead on April 15. (HT File)Retired inspector-general Vijay Shankar Singh feels that the three shooters must have trained for at least a month given the way they handled weapons and fired at Atiq and Ashraf. He points out that they had worked not just on the positions they would take but also on their firing pattern. “They worked on every detail -- down to their movement, position, and the body parts they will target. Everything was synchronised,” added Singh.An ATS officer, who agrees with Singh, said, “I have seen the footage. They must have fired hundreds of rounds in practice to achieve this level of skill. They were well-trained. These men weren’t normal shooters.” The ATS officer further said, “It takes a lot of guts and skill. Just see how one of them approached Atiq and shot him in the temple point blank, then the next fired two shots from the other side, piercing into the heart and neck of Ashraf.”In a similar vein, Ajay Wig, who has been a national-level shooter, said that the hands of the three shooters were steady and they did not use their second hand to support the other one. “Their hands did not quiver for a second, they kept firing till their mission was complete. As I could see in the footage, one shooter was firing with hands stretched fully, neck balanced, and shoulders going a bit towards the back and the hips going downwards a little. These are signs of well-trained shooters,” said Wig.Echoing Wig’s opinion, Varun Mehrotra, who has coached a number of shooters at Kanpur Rifle Club, said “This level of one-hand firing was not possible without undergoing rigorous training. Their trainer must have been a good one.”Interestingly, police reports say that Ashraf too prepared for days in a makeshift firing range in Prayagraj outskirts before killing Raju Pal. His nephew Asad killed in a shootout with STF too was seen improving his firing skills before the Umesh Pal murder case, said people privy to these two incidents.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

Trade between Russia and India has jumped since the invasion, despite western efforts to impose sanctions on Moscow and to cut Russia out of global supply lines.Highlighting its willingness to trade with Russia, the Indian finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said on Monday the country could buy Russian crude oil near or past the level of a G7 price cap on its exports, if Opec’s decision earlier this month to cut output increased global prices.skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, India bought very little oil from Russia.Russia discussing trade ties with India comes as Putin attempts to build closer relations outside the west, including welcoming the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to Moscow last month. China and Russia vowed this week to deepen military cooperation after meetings between Putin and the Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, in Moscow."

                            "summary": "NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Tuesday agreed to work jointly to unlock the full potential of their economic relationship by addressing the trade deficit and market access issues. External affairs minister S Jaishankar co-chaired the 24th session of India-Russia Intergovernmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation with Russia deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, in New Delhi (ANI)These issues were discussed at a meeting of the Inter-governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation that was co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russia’s deputy prime minister Denis Manturov.The commission also discussed ways to step up engagement in trade, finance and energy, including nuclear power.The meeting was held a day after Jaishankar and Manturov said India and Russia are discussing a free trade agreement (FTA) involving the Eurasian Economic Union. The Indian side also flagged its concerns about a widening deficit as two-way trade touched $45 billion, propelled largely by India’s purchases of discounted Russian oilDuring Tuesday’s meeting, the two sides reviewed the entire gamut of the bilateral trade and economic relationship, and “agreed to work together to unlock its full potential, including through addressing the trade deficit and market access issues”, the external affairs ministry said.A readout from the Russian embassy said that the two sides discussed cooperation in trade, finance, industry, energy sector including nuclear power, agriculture, transport, healthcare and education.“Relations between Russia and India continue progressively developing in all directions. In 2022, despite negative external factors, positive dynamics in the Russian-Indian trade prevailed,” the readout said in an apparent reference to the impact of Western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“According to last year’s results, the trade turnover between our countries increased by 2.6 times, exceeding $35 billion. We have completed ahead of schedule the task set by the leaders of our countries to [take] the level of bilateral trade to $30 billion by 2025,” said Manturov, who is also the minister of industry and trade.The inter-governmental commission is a mechanism to monitor the progress of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Manturov, who was accompanied by senior Russian officials, also held bilateral meetings with commerce minister Piyush Goyal, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.During his meeting with Goyal, Manturov discussed the prospect of cooperation in railways, heavy machinery, aircraft building, shipbuilding, metallurgy and chemicals.The need to intensify work on an FTA between the EEU and India to “increase and diversify trade turnover was also noted”, the Russian readout said.At his meeting with Sitharaman, Manturov raised the “necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted mutual settlements, primarily with the use of national currencies”. The mutual interest in concluding an agreement on protection of investments was noted.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

At the meetings, special attention was paid to the development of trade and investment relations, financial and industrial cooperation, the statement said.The meeting assumes significance as Russia remains a trade partner with India while facing sanctions imposed by the US and the EU in the context of its war with Ukraine.In a separate meeting with Goyal, Manturov discussed prospects for cooperation in industries such as railway and heavy machinery, aircraft building, shipbuilding, metallurgy and chemical industry.Manturov also invited Goyal and Indian enterprises to take part in an international industrial exhibition in July in Yekaterinburg.

Oxfam International estimates the top 10% of India’s population holds 77% of national wealth and government data show about 6% pay income tax.Leaders around the world are trying to narrow income gaps, from China President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity program to US President Joe Biden’s proposal of higher taxes for the wealthiest.Modi, who came to power with the strongest mandate in three decades on a platform pledging dignity for the poor, has often been accused of policies that favor the rich. Boosting living standards across the population is also key for India to market itself as a consumer destination that global businesses should target.An overhaul of the six-decade-old income tax law was first proposed under Modi’s predecessor in 2009 but successive governments have failed to complete it. While India has tweaked some tax rates and exemptions for individuals and companies, it is still trying to address some other issues such as standardizing the tax rates on capital gains.The government tried to address this issue partially in the recent budget by taxing debt funds at the income tax rate.With a new direct taxes code, the government is also looking to replace India’s complicated tax system with a simpler law to draw in companies looking to shift their operations out of China amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing. More importantly, it could help burnish India’s credentials as an investment destination after companies such as Vodafone Group Plc and Cairn Energy Plc challenged tax decisions in courts in the past.A new direct taxes law would complete the Modi government’s tax overhaul push after it replaced multiple indirect taxes with a goods and services tax in 2017, transforming India into a single unified market."

The Narendra Modi government has taken the dishonoring of the Indian national flag by separatists very seriously.According to inputs received from Delhi Police, the Home Ministry handed over the investigations to NIA on April 13 after the Special Cell registered a case on the incident on March 23 on the basis of a complaint filed by a London High Commission official present during the time of violence. A case under sections 109147148149120-B448452325 IPC read with Section 13 of UAPA, Section 3(1) of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and section 2 of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 has been registered by the NIA on the same lines as the Delhi Police. Two officials of the Indian High Commission in London sustained grievous injuries during the violence by Sikh radicals.The Delhi Police FIR names Sikh extremist Avtar Singh aka Khanda, Gurcharan Singh and Jasvir Singh as the principal suspects as also the London High Commission made a SOS call to Diplomatic Protection Officer at 345 hours GMT about the breach in the Indian premises by radicals on March 19. The FIR clearly mentions that 50-60 separatists were led by Khanda (who has an Indian passport number F8777***) and yellow turban wearing Gurcharan Singh. Both of these extremists along with Jasvir Singh were recognized by the London High Commission official as taking part in the violence and dishonoring of the Indian Flag. It was Khanda and Gurcharan Singh who instigated the mob to vandalize the High Commission, dishonored the flag and inflicted grievous injuries to the High Commission officials while there was no response from the London Metropolitan Police.While the UK government has tried to dismiss the dishonoring of the Indian National Flag by Sikh extremists as part of their right to protest and freedom of speech, the Narendra Modi government has taken the incident as a barometer of its future relations with the British Government. The Modi government wants strict visible action to be taken against those named in the FIR as Khanda’s parents were both part of the ISI sponsored terrorist movement in Punjab in the 1990s. Khanda’s father was a KLF terrorist named Kulwant Singh Khukrana and mother was related to KLF leader Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala with close connections to Pakistani deep state. Khanda entered Britain on a student visa and now seeks political asylum from the UK government for himself and others by raising human rights violations against his community in India.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

Khanda had pulled down the Tricolour at the mission. He is also learnt to have trained fugitive Khalistani sympathiser Amritpal Singh . An expert in explosives, Khanda has sought UK asylum.“The central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the National Investigation Agency Act , 2008, has been committed. The gravity of the offence and its national and international linkages require that it is probed by the NIA,” the order states. Khanda and his associate, Gurcharan Singh , had allegedly instigated a mob of 50-60 to vandalise the mission, dishonor the National Flag hoisted inside the complex and grievously injure officials."

It happened a day after the Punjab Police launched a crackdown against radical preacher Amritpal Singh in Punjab.The Counter-Terrorism and Counter Radicalisation unit of the Ministry of Home Affairs handed over the case to the NIA and the decision was taken after Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla held a meeting with representatives of the British government last week.In the London incident, the tricolour flying atop the Indian High Commission was grabbed at by a group of protesters waving separatist Khalistani flags and chanting pro-Khalistani slogans, leading to an arrest.Officials from the mission said the attempted but failed attack had been foiled and that the tricolour was now flying grander. The Metropolitan Police said two members of security staff sustained minor injuries which did not require hospital treatment.India had summoned the British deputy high commissioner based in New Delhi and demanded an explanation over the complete absence of security.Also Read | Diaspora gathers in solidarity outside Indian High Commission in LondonIn a strongly-worded statement, the Ministry of External Affairs had said India finds unacceptable the indifference of the U.K. government to the security of Indian diplomatic premises and personnel.Union Home Secretary Bhalla flagged the issue with a U.K. delegation which was led by Permanent Secretary, Home Office, Sir Matthew Rycroft and specifically conveyed New Delhi's concerns on the misuse of U.K.'s asylum status by pro-Khalistani elements to abet terrorist activities and requested better cooperation, increased monitoring of extremists and take proactive action.India's concerns over the breach of security at the Indian High Commission were also emphasised in that meeting."

BL Santosh mishandled everything, Mr Shettar, a Lingayat leader from the Hubballi-Dharwad seat, told NDTV. He will contest from the same seat on a Congress ticket.I have suffered humiliation in the party (BJP) for the last two years and so it became inevitable to join the Congress. If they (BJP) were looking for younger people, why did they give tickets to people over 72 years old? Some 20 of them are there. There is no explanation. They did not say why they do not want to give me a ticket, Mr Shettar said.On April 11, our in-charge said my name is not there; ticket has been denied and I must send a letter of acceptance. 'This is a simple direction by the party', the in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan told me. How is it possible? I am a senior leader. I have won the last six elections with a huge margin of 25,000 votes. The people support me... Why, why, why this humiliation? said the former Chief Minister, visibly upset....Lingayat supporters are angry at the BJP for not making me contest election without any explanation. Many called me, visited me to show support. My being in Congress won't change this, he said when asked whether his supporters would abandon him after his party switch.There was speculation Mr Shettar was offered a Rajya Sabha berth. He, however, did not confirm it.I joined the Congress because time was running out. The last day of nomination is April 20. I had to take the step because of self-respect. I want to contest this election. It is not a revenge against the BJP, the newest senior Congress leader in Karnataka said.Mr Shettar said the BJP did well in the Gujarat election but the same can't be said of Karnataka as the situations are different.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have direct connection with the people (in Gujarat). They have ruled the state for a long time. But here, in Karnataka, the party in-charge doesn't know the ground realities. The party has mishandled the situation, Mr Shettar said.Karnataka will vote on May 10 and counting will take place on May 13."

However, (these days) loyalty to a person is more important than loyalty to the party. Those loyal to him were given priority,” said the former CM, who was a six-time BJP MLA.The ruling party has fielded Mahesh Tenginakayi from Hubli-Dharwad Central, whom Shettar called Santhosh’s “Manasa Putra (blue-eyed boy)”. Said the former CM, “Because of Santhosh’s commitment, he got the ticket.” In 2018, Tenginakayi had to withdraw his nomination from Kalghatgi constituency in Dharwad due to public opposition, said Shettar. Eventually, C M Nimbannavar won on a BJP ticket.The former CM alleged that Santhosh had plans to not field other senior leaders such as Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and S Suresh Kumar. But, fearing blowback over dropping several candidates, the central BJP leader was not able to execute it. Shettar claimed that in Mysuru former minister S A Ramdas was denied a ticket and T S Srivatsa who is close to Santhosh was nominated.Responding to the allegations, Tenginakayi said, “Santhoshji is a Sangh pracharak and working without any desires or aspirations. He does not pick and choose. Any one person cannot take such decisions in the party. Decisions are made by the BJP Parliamentary Board.”Must Read | BJP walks caste tightrope in Karnataka ticket allocation, tries to pacify groups unhappy about quota changesShettar’s allegations have put Santhosh back in the spotlight like in the past few elections. Santhosh and former Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa are known to have been involved in a feud when the former was the BJP general secretary (organisation) of the state unit. The differences between the two camps often came to the fore during the distribution of election tickets. According to party insiders, there has been speculation in the past about Santosh harbouring chief ministerial ambitions and cultivating his coterie of supporters in each district.In the past few years, as Yediyurappa’s influence over the state unit loosened, Santhosh, who hails from Karnataka, tried to assert himself. In the last few elections, such as the Rajya Sabha polls in 2020, Santhosh gained an upper hand as he secured tickets for candidates selected by him, much to the chagrin of some state leaders. For the coming polls too, Santhosh has succeeded in ensuring tickets to several of his loyalists.AdvertisementThough the list of candidates shows that Yediyurappa still continues to have his say in the affairs of the state unit, insiders say that the control of the state BJP office is now firmly in Santhosh’s hands. Shettar on Tuesday made this point, noting that BJP vice president Nirmal Kumar Surana whom Yediyurappa expelled in 2017 was reinstated two years later.Santhosh has been active in the run-up to the May 10 elections, holding meetings with the cadre of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in several parts of the state. Amid speculation that Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah of the Congress could contest from Kolar, he shifted his focus to the constituency and is learnt to have held strategy meetings. In the end, the Congress fielded Siddaramaiah from Varuna in Mysuru district and nominated Kothur G Manjunath from Kolar.Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru that it was Santhosh’s ploy to field minister V Somanna against him even though the Govindrajnagar MLA was not keen on contesting from Varuna."

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 03:01 pm | Updated 03:54 pm IST - BelagaviFormer Karnataka CM Jagadish Shettar, who quit the BJP to join the Congress, believes that he was denied the ticket to contest the Assembly elections by the machinations of party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh, who wanted to groom his supporters.“Mr Santosh saw to it that I did not get the BJP ticket, which went to his loyalist Mahesh Tenginakai instead. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told me that they were in my favour, but did not try hard enough,’‘ he told journalists in his home in Hubballi on April 18.In 2004, after Vijay Sankeshwar resigned from the party, Mr Shettar got a request from late Arun Jaitley, who was then handling Karnataka for the BJP, to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Dharwad. “But, I declined, as I was not interested in national politics. I suggested the name of Pralhad Joshi. I have campaigned harder for Mr Joshi than I have for myself. Now, I only ask Mr Joshi to recall this,’‘ he said.Asked if he would contest as a Congress candidate against Mr Joshi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mr Shettar said he would consider the possibility at the appropriate time.Coming back to Mr Santosh, he said, “Mr Santosh has been in charge of elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal. But he has not succeeded anywhere. I do not understand why the BJP high command trusts him so much with elections in Karnataka, or elsewhere.”BJP claims that party is more important than individuals, but is it?“BJP’s long-held motto has been that the party is more important than any individual. But with his consistent and well-planned actions, Mr Santosh has proved this is not true. Now, Karnataka BJP is in the clutches of a few persons whose writ runs in the party. There is no democratic decision-making in the party any more,’‘ Mr Shettar claimed.“However, mine is not an isolated case. Mr Santosh has been grooming an army of loyalists across Karnataka. He has toppled senior leaders, who had remained loyal to the BJP for decades, only to accommodate his favourites. Long-time leaders, who built the party with hard work, are being shown the door, only to be replaced by ‘yes men’. Even the BJP State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel is his man. Mr Santosh brought Mr Kateel into the core committee, and now, he has been continuing in his position (State unit president) even though his term is over. All this is only because he (Mr Kateel) obeys Mr Santosh. This will lead to weakening of the BJP’s base, and ultimate destruction of the party,’‘ Mr Shettar said.Misinformation campaign to weaken the case of sitting BJP MLAs“Mr Santosh has interfered in ticket distribution in several districts. He has been directing his followers in some constituencies to launch a misinformation campaign against popular leaders. In Hubballi, such a whisper campaign has been going on against me for 6-7 months. Some BJP workers were going around spreading rumours that I was not going to get the ticket this time, and that the decision had been taken by the BJP high command a long time ago. When I came to know of this campaign, I was surprised. How can the party deny the ticket to a six-time MLA who is also a former CM? I brought this to the notice of leaders like (Union Minister) Dharmendra Pradhan in the core committee meeting. But they did not take it seriously,” Mr Shettar said.“In Mysuru, Mr Santosh ensured that his loyalist Sri Vatsa got the ticket instead of S.A. Ramadas, MLA of Krishnaraja. Earlier, Mr Santosh had used another leader, H.V. Rajiv, to speak against Mr Ramadas openly. But the ticket went to Mr Sri Vatsa, and not Mr Rajiv. Some time ago, former minister (and Rajajinagar MLA) S. Suresh Kumar told me about a whisper campaign against him in his constituency.“Young and inexperienced leaders like former IPS officer Annamalai have been made joint in-charge of Karnataka while senior leaders like me are not consulted. That is only because Mr Annamalai is a loyalist of Mr Santosh.”Denial of ticket was not the only reason to leave BJPA visibly upset Mr Shettar reiterated that he was humiliated by the BJP leadership repeatedly.“It may seem that I am upset only because I was denied the ticket. That is not true. I was sidelined. My seniority was not respected, and I was thrown out of the party I built, without basic courtesy. But I kept quiet, as I had high regard for the party. But when they denied me a ticket without informing me beforehand, I could not take it any longer. It was as if the flood gates had opened,” he said.“I would have accepted if the party leaders had invited me to Delhi and intimated me of their decision to drop me. But that was not done. Some person called me on April 11, two days before beginning of filing of nominations and told me that I was not getting the ticket, and that I had to sign a printed form declaring that I had accepted the party’s decision. That was very insulting. I decided to change parties, to retain my self-respect. The only condition I have laid before the Congress is that I should be treated with the respect that I deserve.“Earlier, when leaders like (Union Ministers) Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in charge of Karnataka, they consulted us extensively. We were not consulted by the new dispensation for any important decisions. In the last three years, I was not allowed to speak even for five minutes in the BJP State executive committee, of which I am a long-standing member.”Not scared of I-T raid or EDHe is neither afraid of nor bothered about raids by the income tax department or the Enforcement Directorate. “My life is an open book. There are no dark spots in my 30-year political career. I do not own or run any illegal business. I am not an extremely wealthy man. I only have some limited assets that were created through legal means. Even if the I-T or ED officers raid them, they will not find anything amiss,” the former CM said.There is no confusion in his mind about his ideological suitability in the Congress. “I like to think about it like this — both are national parties that want to work for the poor and marginalised. I have always led a life of probity. I have always had people’s welfare on the top of my mind. I will continue to do that in this party,’‘ he said.CM confident that Jagadish Shettar’s exit will not push Lingayats away from BJPChief Minister Basavaraj Bommai denied the allegation that Mr Santosh had prevented Mr Shettar from getting the BJP ticket, or that the party is in the clutches of a clique.“The party high command is following some principles in the distribution of tickets. There are systems in place. It is a very open and democratic system. Our topmost leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a highly democratic leader,’‘ he told journalists in Mudhol in Bagalkot district.“Mr Shettar is complaining about centralisation of power, but was a centre of power till recently,” he said.The CM does not expect the exit of Mr Shettar or Laxman Savadi to alter the party’s Lingayat base. “Lingayats in Karnataka are vigilant. They take the right decision about various issues. The Congress, had tried to divide the Lingayat community, but is now showing unprecedented love for them. That is nothing, but opportunism,’‘ he said. “The BJP will win a majority of seats in northern Karnataka despite the exit of some leaders.”"

                            "summary": "On April 13, the Solicitor General of India sought to mislead the Supreme Court bench enquiring into the Karnataka government’s decision to scrap reservations to Muslims under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category.The Solicitor General, who represented the government of Karnataka, claimed at the hearing that the third Backward Class Commission headed by Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy had considered Muslims as only educationally backward, not socially backward. He offered this statement as the basis on which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka moved Muslims from the OBC category to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of society category.At the same hearing, Mukul Rohatgi, a former Advocate General of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, also attempted to mislead the Supreme Court bench. Rohtagi, who represented petitioners from Karnataka’s Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities, stated that the reservation given to Muslims in Karnataka was based on religion, which is unconstitutional.Fortunately, Justice. B.V. Nagarathna, one of the two judges hearing the case, intervened immediately and corrected the government counsel, stating that the Justice Chinnappa Reddy Commission had considered Muslims both educationally and socially backward.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the Muslim petitioners, also objected to the Solicitor General’s false contention, while lead judge Justice K.M. Joseph questioned the hurry and impropriety of the Karnataka government in implementing the policy. The court will next hear the matter on April 18.The entire new reservation formula declared by the Basavaraj Bommai-led Karnataka government just before the assembly election slated for May 10 is seriously flawed. But the decision to scrap the 4% reservation for Muslims under the 2-b quota of the OBC category and distribute it among the categories comprising Vokkaligas and the Lingayats is not only the worst of all, but also communal in nature.For one thing, the decision suffers from procedural impropriety, since the state’s Permanent Backward Class Commission had made no such recommendation based on any empirical study.The decision also suffers from illegality and irrationality since it moved, without the support of the law, a group enjoying OBC reservation to the EWS category, which is reserved exclusively for those who are economically weaker and do not suffer social backwardness.While the Supreme Court looks deeply into these factors, a clear understanding of what the comprehensive report of the Third Backward Class Commission, headed by Retired Justice Chinnappa Reddy, really said about the backwardness of the Muslims would cast better light on the plight of the community and the ploys of the government.After a thorough scientific study based on empirical data, the commission had declared Muslims as “socially and educationally backward”. It had also declared that the economic plight of the Muslims is close to that of the scheduled castes and in many educational parameters, Muslims fare worse than the scheduled castes. This statement was made in 1990, some 16 years before the Sachar Committee report of 2006, which made the same observation.This is contrary to the statements made on April 13 by the Solicitor General of India and a former Advocate General of India. The Solicitor General and the Advocate General occupy two of the highest legal offices in the country. Their jobs are to help the Supreme Court deliver justice, not mislead it. That they attempted to mislead the Supreme Court bench hearing the matter suggests that the highest legal offices of the country are more interested in politics than in justice.Also read: Denying OBC Reservation to Muslims Is Unconstitutional and CommunalWorking of the commissionBefore getting into the salient findings and recommendations of the Justice Chinnappa Reddy Commission report of 1990, a little background on both the chair and the commission is necessary.Justice Chinnappa Reddy, a constitutionalist judge of impeccable honesty and high intellectual calibre, had a very rare commitment to social justice.In 1985, in the K.C. Vasanth Kumar and Another vs State of Karnataka case, Justice Reddy was part of the bench which stipulated the parameters to identify the Other Backward Classes in the country based on their social and educational backwardness.The Karnataka government appointed Justice Chinnappa Reddy as the chairman of the Third Backward Class Commission in 1988. It asked the commission to review the reports of previous Backward Class Commissions, evolve parameters and identify classes in Karnataka eligible for OBC reservations and recommend other policy measures required for the OBCs in Karnataka.Justice Chinnappa Reddy considered “economic and cultural impoverishment and social deprivations” as the causes of perpetual backwardness, stating that these factors perpetuate disadvantages based on class, status and power. While poverty was considered an indicator of economic impoverishment and educational attainments an indicator of cultural impoverishment, the commission also considered social deprivation as stemming from a structure based on hierarchical caste and community status.To evolve quantifiable indicators to reflect on all these factors, the commission considered:1) Caste- and community-based poverty level in comparison with the corresponding state averages;2) Caste and community averages of students appearing in the SSLC (state board examination at the 10th standard, the first and biggest elimination stage on the education ladder) in comparison with the state average;3) The representation of the castes and communities in the higher education in comparison with the state average; and4) The representation of the castes and the communities in the state services, including government departments, state undertakings and universities.The commission sought empirical data for these questions from all the state departments and affiliates. It also visited more than 500 villages across Karnataka and got first-hand information about the plight and demands of the people.The commission then adopted the estimation of the castecommunity population that had been made by the Second Backward Class Commission headed by T. Venkataswamy in 1983, based on the 1931 census and by visiting lakhs of homes. Accordingly, the Chinnappa Reddy Commission estimated the population of Karnataka in 1988 as 4.4 crores, of which Brahmins were estimated to comprise 3.45%, Lingayats 15.33%, Vokkaligas 10.8%, scheduled castes 16.71% and Muslims 11.67%.Educational backwardnessTo quantify educational backwardness, the commission considered a caste-wise distribution of candidates who had appeared at the 1988 SSLC examinations and a caste-wise distribution of those who passed the same examinations. While the state population in 1988 was 4.4 crores, around 3.4 lakh students appeared in the SSLC examination. Thus, 0.77% of the state population took the SSLC examinations in 1988, of whom 0.33% passed the examinations.The commission then took the figure of 0.77% as the state average in SSLC appearance and compared it with a caste-wise average of appearance. If the percentage of any caste appearing for the examinations was above 0.77%, the caste was considered educationally forward. If it was below 0.77%, the caste or community was considered educationally backward to the extent of its percentage.This empirical data showed that while only 0.77% of the state population could take the SSLC, 1.41% of the Brahmin population, which was around 15 lakhs, was able to take the SSLC examinations, which was twice the state average. The Vokkaliga community at 1.10%, and the Lingayat community at 0.94%, had also appeared for the SSLC, obviously above the state average.On the other hand only 0.59% of the population of scheduled castes could take the SSLC exams in 1988 – 23% less than the state average of 0.77%.But the case of the Muslim population was worse. In 1988, only 0.48% of the Muslim population of 51.47 lakhs took the SSLC exams – 37% less than the state average of 0.77% and 14% less than the scheduled castes average.Higher education backwardnessThe commission also sought caste- and community-wise data of enrolment into medical, engineering, agricultural and other such professional courses and also of the admissions to postgraduate colleges to prepare consolidated comparative caste- and community-wise data for admission to higher education.The empirical date suggested that out of around 10,000 admissions into the different streams of higher education described above, in 1988, students belonging to the Brahmin community had captured 2,215 seats – 21.46% of the seats. This meant that a caste with a 3.45% population in the state had garnered 21.46% of the seats in higher education.The scheduled castes, with a population of 16.71% in the state, had only 14.44% of the higher education seats in spite of statutory reservations.But Muslims, with 11.67% of the population of the state, had only 5.71% of the higher education seats, even with the then existing reservations for the community under the OBC category. In other words, Muslims had accounted for less than half their share in the state population, while Brahmins accounted for seven times more than their population share. But now, according to the Karnataka government’s decision to scrap the 4% reservation for Muslims in the OBC category, Muslims will share the EWS category with Brahmins.These empirical studies conducted by the Chinnappa Reddy Commission conclusively proved the necessity of exclusive educational reservation for Muslims under Article 15 (4) of the Indian constitution.Representation in government servicesNext, the Chinnappa Reddy commission dived deep into caste- and community-wise representation in government services to estimate the reservations required for different communities under Article 16 (4) of the Constitution of India.The commission sent detailed questionnaires to different departments and sought the required information for Groups A and B services, junior engineers and assistant engineers, Group C, and recruitments to Groups A, B, C, and D in all government departments, universities, affiliates of the Government and so on.After analysing this empirical data, the commission found that Brahmins, who constituted 3.5% of the state’s population, had shares of 18.12% in Group A, and 26.43% in the recruitment of the posts in Groups A and B in public sector undertakings.Meanwhile, Muslims, who comprised 11.67% of the population, secured only 7% of the recruitment to government services, despite reservations.What will happen to Muslims now, if the community’s OBC reservation is removed and they are asked to compete with Brahmins?Social backwardness of MuslimsIn its summary about the situation of Muslims, the commission quoted the findings of a study by Professor G. Thimmaiah of the Institute of Social and Economic Change. The report stated: “According to a study conducted by G. Thimmaiah of the Institute Of Social and Economic Change, which covered the period of 1974-75, 56.5% of the Muslim population in the state was below the poverty line compared with 31.4% among the Christians and 45.2% among the Hindus. Only the scheduled castes (58.4%) and the scheduled tribes (66.3%) had a high population living below the poverty line.”The commission also observed, “By this study, it has been concluded that the Muslims are very close to the Scheduled Castes as far as economic conditions are concerned.”One and a half decades later, the Sachar Commission report of 2006 came to a similar conclusion.The Chinnappa Reddy Commission also made this observation about Muslims in page 142 of volume 1 of its report: “Two striking things about the Muslim community in Karnataka are the extreme economic and cultural poverty of the vast majority of the community and the wide gap that separates the rich and the poor members of the community.” (Emphasis mine.)Based on scientific studies and empirical date, the Third Backward Class Commission headed by Justice Chinnappa Reddy concluded that:“The picture presented by the Muslim Community as a whole is that of a socially and educationally backward class.” (Emphasis mine.)The Chinnappa Reddy commission thus recommended that Muslims should be grouped in category 2 of the OBC category. Based on this recommendation, the Veerappa Moily government, on September 17, 1994, categorised Muslims under 2-b of the OBC category and provided them with 4% reservation.Thus, even a cursory glance at Third Backward Class Commission of Karnataka’s report shows that all the BJP government’s arguments in favour of removing reservations for the Muslims from the OBC category are unconstitutional and ill-intentioned."

Describing the Janata Dal (Secular) as the B-team of the Congress, he said on Twitter that the BJP will stand strongly with these communities and will make sure it is with them for their progress.AdvertisementHe used the hashtag anti-Hindu Congress to target the opposition party. While Karnataka Congress leaders want to reverse reservation, Rahul Gandhi dropped into Karnataka and said he wants to breach the Supreme Court limit on reservations, the BJP MP from the state tweeted. So the Congress politics of lies and promise and scoot politics continues. That is why voters chose BJP bcoz we deliver what we promise, he said. Gandhi n Monday demanded the release of the caste census which he said was done during the UPA government and also called for lifting the reservation cap."

                            "summary": "The Supreme Court today adjourned hearing of a plea challenging Karnataka Government's Order (GO) scraping off the nearly three-decade-old 4% OBC reservation provided to Muslims under Category 2B.A bench of Justices KM Joseph and BV Nagarathna will now hear the matter on next Tuesday.The undertaking given by the Karnataka government last week that no admissions or appointments would be made in pursuance of the GO, will continue till then.Nothing irreversible will happen, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had assured the Court last week, when the matter was first heard. The Court had then recorded the submission of SG that no appointment or admission is going to be made till 18.04.2023 on the basis of the impugned GO.Court had also asked the State to file its affidavit in the matter.The GO is apparently based on an interim report of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes. The Court stated that the State could have waited for the final report before revoking the reservations provided to Muslims in the State. Prima facie, the impugned GO appears to suggests that the foundation of the decision making process is highly shaky and flawed, it had said.On the face, they (Muslims) have been enjoying this position for a very long time...On basis of documents produced, Muslims are backward and then suddenly it is changed, Justice Joseph had said.Senior Advocates Kapil Sibal and Dushyant Dave appearing for the Muslim community argued that reservations cannot be for political reasons. Dave submitted on the basis of empirical data and material, it has been found that Muslims are a backward community in Karnataka and they were entitled to reservations.The Karnataka Government had scrapped the 4% reservation and distributed the same equally among the Veerashaiva-Lingayats and Vokkaligas at 2% each.Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for the Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities argued that the matter did not simply pertain to revocation of reservations but also the allocation of reservations to a different community. He submitted that the Lingayats and the Vokkaligas would be prejudiced if an interim stay on the GO is granted."

                            "summary": "||||BENGALURU: Buoyed by its freshly acquired national party status, AAP is hoping to open its account in the Karnataka legislative assembly in the May 10 polls. Of the total 224 constituencies, it plans to field some 200 candidates.Also See: Karnataka Election 2023 Live AAP did not contest the 2013 polls and it failed to make a mark in 2018 when it contested 28 seats. It bagged a measly 0.06% vote share, and all its candidates lost their deposits.But much has changed in the five years since. Not only did the Arvind Kejrival-led party win elections in Punjab, but it also spread its tentacles beyond Delhi, and made its presence felt in elections in Gujarat and Goa. Now, it is attempting to make a mark in Karnataka , where it elicited a good response for its crusade against corruption in its original avatar, India Against Corruption, way back in 2011.“Our party has emerged stronger, and it definitely is a force to reckon with,” said AAP campaign committee chairman Mukhyamantri Chandru. “While Kejrival’s influence is well-pronounced, the good performance in recent polls and the national party tag has given us traction. ”AAP has announced 168 candidates and is expected to release a final list of about 30 nominees soon. Chandru said the party is confident of a good performance in at least 15 seats, insisting that its presence will be felt most inseats in Bengaluru city.Yet, Anekal Doddaiah, its nominee in Ron seat in Gadag district, has emerged as the most ‘winnable’. The seat has traditionally seen a straight fight between BJP and Congress, butlocals say the strong presence of Doddaiah makes it a triangular contest for the first time, and that they would not be surprised if AAP pulled off an upset.While Congress has announced GS Patil as its candidate, BJP is yet to decide on whether to replace incumbent MLA Kalakappa Bandi.As his name suggests, Doddaiah, 40, is from Anekal taluk, Bengaluru Rural. He was originally in BJP and was a loyalist of KS Eshwarappa till 2017, when he was expelled from the party. He served as state secretary of the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade which Eshwarappa launched. He was also instrumental in building the movement seeking ST status for Kurubas.Doddaiah joined AAP last year and zeroed in on Ron since Kurubas number about 60,000 voters in the 2. 3lakh electorate.The second biggest chunk is that of Panchamasali Lingayats, who are miffed with Congress as the party is fielding a ReddyLingayat for the second time in a row. Although Bandi is a Panchamasali, he is facing huge anti-incumbency.“I have been working in the constituency for about two years and have established a good rapport with voters,” said Doddaiah. “Besides, the caste equation and prevailing political situation is favourable for me. ”However, BJP and Congress functionaries dismissed Doddaiah’s chances. “He is an outsider who appea. red on the scene recently. Moreover, AAP does not have a presence here,” said Mahesh Tenginakayi, BJP general secretary.Apart from Ron, AAP functionaries hope to do well in Mahalakshmi Layout, Bidar South, and Devanahalli."

                            "summary": "It is being discussed that Siddaramaiah not getting a ticket to contest from Kolar in the third list of the Congress is a setback him. However, the strongman of the Congress in the Mysuru region has asserted his hold by getting ticket to his loyalists in two segments – Krishnaraja (KR) and Chamaraja (CR) – in Mysuru city.Congress leaders close to Siddaramaiah said fortunately, there were no choices of KPCC president D K Shivakumar in most of the segments in Mysuru district, including in the city.Both segments are represented by the BJP - by S A Ramadass and L Nagendra respectively - at present. The BJP is yet to declare its candidate in KR, while it has repeated Nagendra in CR. The Congress ticket is given to former MLA M K Somasekhar in KR, while it is given to K Harish Gowda in CR.Also Read | Jagadish Shettar joins Congress after quitting BJP ahead of the Karnataka pollsHarish Gowda was a rebel JD(S) candidate in the 2018 Assembly poll in CR, when former vice-chancellor K S Rangappa was a JD(S) official candidate. The division of the votes between Rangappa and Gowda in the Vokkaliga dominated segment of CR resulted in the victory of Nagendra, a former chairman of Mysuru Urban Development Authority.The JD(S) has repeated its candidate former corporator KV Mallesh in KR, while it has issued a ticket to H K Ramesh, JD(S) city secretary, in CR. Ramesh is the son of the late MLA H Kempegowda, who was Janata Party MLA from Chamaraja in 1983 and 1985.Somashekar, a two-term MLA, once JD(S) (2004) and once Congress (2013), was a natural choice for KR. However, he had contenders in N M Naveen Kumar and former corporator M Pradeep Kumar. Naveen is the son of former MUDA chairman K R Mohan Kumar, who joined the BJP along with MP V Srinivas Prasad in 2017. However, Mohan became inactive in politics, while Naveen became active in Congress. Somashekar has lost thrice against incumbent MLA Ramadass. Somashekar is a supporter of Siddaramaiah since his 1980 Lok Sabha poll.It was almost certain that Harish Gowda would get a ticket as he joined the Congress at the behest of Siddaramaiah after the 2018 Assembly poll. Besides, it is a known fact that former MLA Vasu is usually favoured by former CM M Veerappa Moliy. Somehow Siddaramaiah had an aversion towards Vasu even though Vasu’s term was described as the ‘development era’ of Chamaraja segment.Besides, Vasu’s son Kaveesh Gowda, secretary of Vidya Vikas group of educational institutions, recently joined the BJP. Now, Kaveesh is the BJP candidate in Chamundeshwari segment. Moily’s efforts to get a ticket for Vasu did not yield results against Siddaramaiah’s wish."

                            "summary": "Her husband Ambareesh was a popular actor and leader of the Congress in Karnataka. In 2019, a year after his death, Sumalatha Ambareesh won the Lok Sabha elections as an Independent from Mandya with the Congress’s help. This time around, Sumalatha, who trumped the Janata Dal (Secular) in its bastion, is backing the BJP in the coming Assembly elections.Asked about reports that she was planning to contest from Mandya, Sumalatha recently clarified that the BJP did not ask her to do so. But state BJP spokesperson MG Mahesh told The Indian Express that the MP could still be fielded from Mandya if the situation demanded it. “There is a lot of time and things are very dynamic. It can change at any moment. If the situation demands it, we will field Sumalatha from the BJP.”In Premium | BJP walks caste tightrope in Karnataka ticket allocation, tries to pacify groups unhappy about quota changesSumalatha’s detractors said she would not have a “strong impact” because of a restricted support base and that she won the 2019 polls largely due to support from the Congress and farmers’ groups. Her support for the BJP and silence on the “Nandini vs Amul” debate did not go down well with Ambareesh’s followers, according to some local leaders. The Mandya District Co-operative Milk Producers Society’s Union Ltd, is one of the largest milk cooperatives in the state, with lakhs of farmers selling milk to 1,279 dairy cooperative societies.But MG Mahesh said Sumalatha’s support for the party would make a “big difference” in the district. “Sumalatha Ambareesh brings a good share of Ambareesh followers as well and she also has great women following being a woman MP as well. We are anticipating good results in all seven Assembly seats of the district.”The BJP has been making attempts to breach Mandya, which is a stronghold of the JD(S) and where the Congress also has some presence, and getting Sumalatha’s support is part of its plans. In 2018, the results in the district were overwhelmingly in the favour of the JD(S) that won all seven seats. A rift between then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Ambareesh is said to have contributed to the Congress’s failure. Five years earlier, the grand old party won two seats and got the support of Karnataka Sarvodaya Party MLA KS Puttannaiah of Melkote.Mandya is part of the Old Mysuru region where both the Opposition parties are dominant. While the Congress emerged on top here in 2008 and 2013, winning 26 and 23 of the 48 Assembly seats respectively, the JD(S) was the victor last time as it bagged 25 of the Assembly constituencies and the Congress tally dropped to 16. This Opposition stranglehold is what the BJP is trying to break and the ruling party has been focusing on Mandya since August when the state core committee decided at a meeting that Old Mysuru was among its priorities. Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed an event in Mandya in December.The BJP strategy has involved bringing back Tipu Sultan into the focus, alleging that the 18th-Century ruler of Mysuru demolished a Hanuman temple to build the Jamia Masjid in Srirangapatna that stands to this day. The BJP, including its state chief Nalin Kateel, also claimed that Tipu was killed by Vokkaliga chieftains Uri Gowda and Nanje Gowda and not the British. The ruling party erected an arch in Mandya hailing the Gowdas ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on March 12 to inaugurate the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. The arch was later replaced with that of Vokkaliga seer Sri Balagangadharanatha Swami.Advertisement“A new wave has begun in Mandya district. You will see sensational results and it will surprise everybody,” Sumalatha said as she extended her support to the BJP. On Sunday, she held closed-door meetings and campaigned for the party in Maddur on Monday. Taking the JD(S) to task, she said dynastic politics needs to end and it was time to teach a fitting lesson to the seven MLAs of the Kumaraswamy-led party. She said the BJP fields party workers who are deserving. The MP also took a dig at the JD(S) for neglecting Mandya’s development and said some people received votes, but development was taken elsewhere."

                            "summary": "The ruling BJP and Opposition Congress and JDS are expected to spring last-minute surprises with changes in constituencies and candidates before the deadline on Thursday evening for filing nominations.Karnataka is scheduled to have assembly polls on May 10.Independent MP from Mandya, Sumalatha, may file her nomination from Mandya to curb the influence of JDS, led by former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. The district, with seven seats and dominated by Vokkaligas, had always been a stronghold of the JDS. Hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Mandya, Sumalatha pledged her support to the PM.The BJP, which has been struggling to establish its toehold, is planning to have Sumalatha in the fray from Mandya and give a tough contest to JDS. Kumaraswamy, speaking to reporters in the district, said he had been under pressure from people to contest from Mandya, but his voters in Channapatna were not ready to let him go. “Sumalatha is throwing a challenge (at us), arrogantly. If she contests, I will not, but will field a woman and get her elected,” he said.The district has been on the BJP’s radar ever since home minister Amit Shah addressed a mega rally here in December which was later amplified by a roadshow by Modi. The JDS had had such an overwhelming influence that it won all seven seats in the 2018 assembly polls. The BJP, however, created history when it won the KR Pet seat in the December 2019 bypolls after local MLA KC Narayana Gowda switched sides, along with 16 others, to help the saffron party form the government.With both CM aspirants, Kumaraswamy as well as state Congress chief DK Shivakumar hailing from the old Mysuru region, the JDS and Congress have been focusing heavily on the 57 assembly seats falling in the region.The Congress is also planning to counter the BJP in Padmanabhanagar in Bengaluru and in CM’s constituency of Shiggaon, according to unconfirmed reports. There were speculations that the Congress may field Shivakumar’s brother and Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh against Revenue Minister R Ashoka in Padmanabhanagar to make his life tough. In his second seat in Kanakapura, Ashoka has taken on Shivakumar. The Congress, sources said, may announce a strong surprise candidate to take on Ashoka in Padmanabhanagar in a bid to defeat in both the seats he is contesting from.The Congress is also said to be weighing shifting former minister Vinay Kulkarni to the CM's constituency of Shiggon after a court in Bengaluru refused him permission to enter Dharwad district. The Congress has announced his name for Dharwad, but the Supreme Court has barred his entry into the district after the CBI named him in a 2016 murder case.With the war between the Congress and BJP turning bitter by the day, there were speculations that Kulkarni may move to Shiggaon and take on the CM. He is a Panchamasali, the largest subgroup among the Lingayats, and Shiggaon has a large proportion of Panchamasalis, followed by Muslims."

I urge @PMOIndia @narendramodi, @HMOIndia, @MEAIndia and @BSBommai to immediately intervene & ensure their safe return.”It is reported that 31 people from Karnataka belonging to Hakki Pikki tribe, are stranded in Sudan which is troubled by civil war. I urge @PMOIndia @narendramodi, @HMOIndia, @MEAIndia and @BSBommai to immediately intervene & ensure their safe return. — Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) April 18, 2023“Hakki Pikkis in Sudan are left stranded without food since the last few days & the govt is yet to initiate action to bring them back. BJP govt should immediately open diplomatic discussions & reach out to international agencies to ensure the well-being of Hakki Pikkis,” he said on Twitter. “It is also unfortunate to know that we have lost one Indian & 60 others in the ongoing civil war in Sudan. My deepest condolences to their families and pray for the peace in the region,” the Congress leader, who is leading the election campaign ahead of the Assembly elections in Karnataka, said.Responding sharply, Jaishankar said, “Simply appalled at your tweet! There are lives at stake; don’t do politics. Since the fighting started on April 14th, the Embassy of India in Khartoum has been continuously in touch with most Indian Nationals and PIOs in Sudan.”Simply appalled at your tweet!

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) April 18, 2023“Their details and locations cannot be made public for security reasons. Their movement is constrained by fierce fighting that is ongoing. Plans regarding them have to take into account a very complicated security scenario. The Embassy is in constant touch with the Ministry in that regard. It is grossly irresponsible of you to politicize their situation. No electoral goal justifies endangering Indians abroad,” the External Affairs minister said.As Sudanese capital Khartoum continued to witness large-scale violence, the Indian embassy in Sudan has issued at least two advisories since Saturday and also set up a control room at the Ministry of External Affairs.“Based on the latest inputs, the fighting has not subsided on day two. We sincerely request all fellow Indians to continue to stay where they are and not venture outside,” the mission had said in its second advisory after violence broke out in Khartoum."

                            "summary": "Kanakapura, Karnataka: D.K. Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), filed his nomination for the state elections on Monday, April 17, in his native Kanakapura constituency after praying at the temple of the local deity, Kenkeramma.Shivakumar, a seven-time MLA from the Congress who is known as the party’s money man, is a contender for the post of chief minister along with Siddaramaiah, who currently serves as the leader of the opposition in the state assembly.Having arrived in Kanakapura from Bengaluru on a two-wheeler, Shivakumar held a massive roadshow before filing his nomination. Addressing the crowd, he expressed his confidence that the Congress party would form the government in the state with 150 seats to their credit.The Shettar effectShivakumar’s confidence at the public gathering perhaps stemmed partly from the fact that veteran politician Jagadish Shettar, a former chief minister of Karnataka, recently quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined the Congress. Jagadish Shettar is from the north Karnataka region, which is a bastion of the BJP.Shettar joined the Congress on April 17 in the presence of Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge who also hails from Karnataka, D.K. Shivakumar and Siddaramiah. He said he had left the BJP because the party denied him a ticket in the forthcoming elections. Though the media reported that BJP president J.P. Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah had promised Shettar a governorship, Shettar said he was kept in the dark and denied a ticket at the last minute.Given Shettar’s resignation from the BJP, the media speculates that the saffron party is sidelining senior leaders such as B.S. Yediyurappa and Shettar. But the BJP has refrained from any public show of bad blood. In fact, Basavaraj Bommai, the current chief minister of the state, has expressed regret for Shettar’s resignation.The BJP’s caution stems from the fact that the Lingayat community, which is supposed to constitute 17% of the population of Karnataka, can make or break the fortunes of candidates in about 95 constituencies in North Karnataka. The supposed disrespect by the Congress party in 1989 to former chief minister Veerendra Patil, a member of the Lingayat community, had affected the party’s fortunes in the state.Shettar is one of several BJP leaders who have joined the Congress. But he did not sound happy about it. At the press conference to welcome him to the party, Shettar said he had been humiliated by the BJP which was unfortunate because his family had been associated with the saffron party since the days of its predecessor, the Jan Sangh.Also Read: Jagadish Shettar, Laxman Savadi and the Obvious Dent in BJP’s Lingayat Base in KarnatakaShivakumar’s rivalsWhether or not the Congress wins the assembly elections, Shivakumar himself is expected to win the Kanakapura constituency. He is a leader from the Vokkaliga community of the Old Mysore region, where the Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] enjoys considerable clout and hopes to play kingmaker in the event of a hung assembly.The Kanakapura constituency usually provides the JD(S) with 50,000 to 60,000 votes. The JD(S) stands second in the affection of the people, while the Congress ranks first and the BJP has always stood a distant third.But this time, the BJP has fielded R. Ashok, the current revenue minister of Karnataka, to stand from Kanakapura. Ashok is also contesting from his native Padmanabhanagara constituency in Bengaluru, which he won in the 2018 assembly elections. Worried that the Kanakapura electorate believes he will return to Padmanabhanagara if he wins both seats, Ashok has assured the locals that he will retain the Kanakapura seat if he wins it.In the past, the Kanakapura constituency elected P.G.R. Sindya from the Janatha Paksha, the former avatar of the Janata Dal, five times. In his 30 years in the assembly, Sindhia served variously as the home, finance and transport minister of the state. Now he has retired from active politics not only due to his age, but also to the fact that when the assembly constituencies were redrawn, Shivakumar’s original constituency of Sathanur was merged with Kanakapura.Constituency cluesAshok’s candidature in Kanakapura may not go down well with locals, said A.N. Prakash, a cloth store owner in Kanakapura town.“Ashok is not a local candidate and has not visited the area even once after his candidature was announced from here. Meanwhile, the JD(S) has always stood second here so far. It will be a smooth ride here for the Congress party’s Shivakumar, but I can’t say how the party will fare in the entire state,” Prakash told The Wire.Auto drivers Gurulinga and Prasanna also believe that Shivakumar will win Kanakapura. Unlike Prakash however, they also think the Congress could win the state. “The BJP has dented our incomes by increasing fuel prices,” they said.In the Kanakapura constituency, Shivakumar is credited with several development projects, including the facilitation of the construction of a new maternity hospital in town by the Infosys Foundation.According to a journalist who has spent 15 years covering local news, in fielding Ashok, the BJP hopes to make some inroads in Kanakapura and increase its voter base. Praveen Shetty, who runs a hotel in the town, adds that the local BJP cadre has become active since Ashok’s candidature was announced.However, N.H. Venugopal, a Congress supporter, said, “DK brought a prominence to Kanakapura that had been absent even after we sent Sindya to the assembly for 30 years. We want our man to become the chief minister.”Unofficial estimates peg the population of the Vokkaliga community in Kanakapura at 44.1% (98,000), the Kuruba community at 2.7% (6,000), the Lingayat community at 8.1% (18,000), the minority community at 9.9% (22,000) and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities at 19.8% (44,000).The Kanakapura assembly constituency was listed as the most backward taluk by the Nanjundappa Committee in 2002. But Shivakumar is credited with developing the area. His brother D.K. Suresh is currently a member of parliament from the Bangalore Rural parliamentary constituency, of which the Kanakapura assembly constituency is a part.G. Ram Mohan is a freelance journalist."

The senior party leader, who served as housing and infrastructure development minister is the outgoing cabinet, was also the minister in-charge of Mysuru district.Visuals showed villagers surrounding the minister and asking questions about development in the constituency. Several BJP leaders, including Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, were seen trying to intervene. They were also seen asking people not to record the exchange between Mr Somanna and the villagers.Elected from Govindraj Nagar Assembly constituency in the 2018 election, Mr Somanna has been fielded from two seats this time -- Varuna and Chamarajanagara.A former Congress leader who switched to the BJP in 2009, Mr Somanna faces the formidable Siddaramaiah in Varuna. The seat, ever since it was formed in 2008, has backed the Congress veteran, sending him and then his son Yathindra Siddaramaiah to the Assembly. The Congress veteran is one of the frontrunners for the Chief Minister post if the party wins the polls and his supporters will leave no stone unturned to ensure his victory in Varuna.The BJP, however, is confident that Mr Somanna will beat the Congress heavyweight.Addressing a party meeting in support of the BJP leader, Chief Minister Basavaraj S Bommai said Mr Somanna is a model for development.The name of Varuna will go beyond the Mysuru district and he got the blessings of the Goddess Chamundeshwari. V Somanna means 'Victory' Somanna. A lot of changes have taken place in Karnataka politics. A few enjoyed power in the name of oppressed classes. They grew in politics but the community remained backward, he said.The BJP also aims to tap into the Lingayat voter base in Varuna by fielding Mr Somanna, who is from the community.The senior leader recently told the media that the Varuna constituency was not new for him because he had campaigned for Siddaramaiah during the bypolls at Chamundeshwari in Mysuru, back when they were in the same party. I will do my job, he was quoted as saying in a report by news agency PTI.The Congress veteran, too, is sure of a win. I will win with people's support. Let Somanna or anybody contest against me... I am not worried about the opponent as I have full faith in the people of Varuna, Mr Siddaramaiah said."

He wished to know how nomination papers are filed and how campaigning is done. So, he came with me. His father [Rakesh] was very interested in politics but died early,” Mr. Siddaramaiah told reporters.It was for the first time that Mr. Davan, who lives in Bengaluru, was seen publicly with Mr. Siddaramaiah and Dr. Yathindra."

                            "summary": "MYSURU: The BJP announced the candidature of minister V Somanna from Varuna has given some hope to Lingayats here to elect a community leader to the assembly from Mysuru district.Though it is not an easy task, Lingayat leaders are pinning hopes on the number of community voters in the segment. Former CM Siddaramaiah, who was earlier elected twice after it was carved out of Chamundeshwari and T Narasipura segments, has returned to the constituency to contest the 2023 election. His son Yathindra Siddaramaiah was elected from Varuna in 2018 and he has now paved the way to his father.Lingayats, who have been demanding political parties to field a community leader in Mysuru, are hoping that parties will field another Lingayat from Krishnaraja segment.The last time Mysuru, which currently has 11 assembly segments, elected a Lingayat leader was in 1999. Guruswamy AS, a Congress leader from Chamundeshwari, and HC Basavaraju, a BJP leader, were elected from Mysuru more than two decades ago. Since then, no Lingayat leader has been elected from the district despite they being the deciding factors in two-three constituencies.H Gangadharan, who was elected from Krishnaraja in Mysuru city in 1978 (from JNP) and 1983 (BJP) was a prominent Lingayat leader. The district had elected Rajashekar Murthy in 1989 from Chamundeshwari.Akhila Bharat Veerashaiva Mahasabha national committee executive member TS Lokesh told TOI that the community members are happy and thanked BJP for fielding a strong and veteran leader like Somanna from Varuna. “We were expecting local leaders to be fielded. We will however work for his victory by taking all the sections of society into confidence,” he said.“We have been requesting all parties to field Lingayat leaders. Except Congress, both BJP and JD(S) have been giving tickets to Lingayats for the assembly elections in the recent past. Even some Congress leaders from the community are unhappy with their leaders as they are still dilly-dallying in announcing candidates for Krishnaraja, which is currently represented by SA Ramadas, a Brahmin,” he said.BJP has fielded three Lingayat leaders in Chamarajanagar district – Gundlupet (CS Niranjana), Hanur (Preetham Nagappa), and Chamarajanagar (V Somanna), while Congress has fielded HS Mahadevaprasad’s son Ganesh Prasad, a Lingayat."

Mr. Siddaramaiah became the Chief Minister after his victory from Varuna.Mr. Siddaramaiah had contested from Chamundeshwari and Badami in the 2018 elections but he won from Badami and lost to JD(S) candidate and one-time associate G.T. Deve Gowda in Chamundeshwari. The former CM had won five times from Chamundeshwari in his political career spanning over four decades.The party workers are excited here with the former CM shifting to his home constituency. His birthplace, Siddaramanahundi, falls under Varuna.Mr. Siddaramaiah has announced that it is his last election and expressed confidence of romping home comfortably despite BJP fielding Housing Minister V. Somanna, an MLA from Govindarajanagar in Bengaluru, against him as part of the party’s strategy to give tough fight to its opponents in the Congress, including KPCC chief D.K. Shivakumar in Kanakapura where Revenue Minister R. Ashok is the fray.A grand roadshow is expected to unfold when Mr. Siddaramaiah goes to file his papers for the seat at the RO’s office in Nanjangud. Senior leaders from the district are expected to accompany Mr. Siddaramaiah, who is an aspirant for the CM’s post.The constituency from where the former CM would be contesting had become a big debate ahead of the ticket announcement since Mr. Siddaramaiah had himself admitted that he had offers to contest from many constituencies but had expressed his wish to contest from Kolar. But the party decided to field him from Varuna and none in the Congress have been fielded from two seats in the ensuing elections."

Trade between Russia and India has jumped since the invasion, despite western efforts to impose sanctions on Moscow and to cut Russia out of global supply lines.Highlighting its willingness to trade with Russia, the Indian finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said on Monday the country could buy Russian crude oil near or past the level of a G7 price cap on its exports, if Opec’s decision earlier this month to cut output increased global prices.skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, India bought very little oil from Russia.Russia discussing trade ties with India comes as Putin attempts to build closer relations outside the west, including welcoming the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to Moscow last month. China and Russia vowed this week to deepen military cooperation after meetings between Putin and the Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, in Moscow."

External affairs minister S Jaishankar co-chaired the 24th session of India-Russia Intergovernmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific and Cultural Cooperation with Russia deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, in New Delhi (ANI)These issues were discussed at a meeting of the Inter-governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation that was co-chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russia’s deputy prime minister Denis Manturov.The commission also discussed ways to step up engagement in trade, finance and energy, including nuclear power.The meeting was held a day after Jaishankar and Manturov said India and Russia are discussing a free trade agreement (FTA) involving the Eurasian Economic Union. The Indian side also flagged its concerns about a widening deficit as two-way trade touched $45 billion, propelled largely by India’s purchases of discounted Russian oilDuring Tuesday’s meeting, the two sides reviewed the entire gamut of the bilateral trade and economic relationship, and “agreed to work together to unlock its full potential, including through addressing the trade deficit and market access issues”, the external affairs ministry said.A readout from the Russian embassy said that the two sides discussed cooperation in trade, finance, industry, energy sector including nuclear power, agriculture, transport, healthcare and education.“Relations between Russia and India continue progressively developing in all directions. In 2022, despite negative external factors, positive dynamics in the Russian-Indian trade prevailed,” the readout said in an apparent reference to the impact of Western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“According to last year’s results, the trade turnover between our countries increased by 2.6 times, exceeding $35 billion. We have completed ahead of schedule the task set by the leaders of our countries to [take] the level of bilateral trade to $30 billion by 2025,” said Manturov, who is also the minister of industry and trade.The inter-governmental commission is a mechanism to monitor the progress of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Manturov, who was accompanied by senior Russian officials, also held bilateral meetings with commerce minister Piyush Goyal, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.During his meeting with Goyal, Manturov discussed the prospect of cooperation in railways, heavy machinery, aircraft building, shipbuilding, metallurgy and chemicals.The need to intensify work on an FTA between the EEU and India to “increase and diversify trade turnover was also noted”, the Russian readout said.At his meeting with Sitharaman, Manturov raised the “necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted mutual settlements, primarily with the use of national currencies”. The mutual interest in concluding an agreement on protection of investments was noted.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

The meeting was co-chaired by Denis Manturov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade and Industry from Russia and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.“The sides reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral trade and economic relationship, and agreed to work together to unlock its full potential including addressing the trade deficit and market access issues,” said the MEA in a press note.Speaking at a business event organised by the FICCI on Monday, Mr. Manturov flagged the issue of payments in bilateral trade that had deepened in the backdrop of the western sanctions on Russia. Apart from interacting with Mr. Jaishankar, the Russian Minister also met Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.“The visit is in continuation of the regular high-level dialogue between the two Sides,” the press note said."

Illegal gratification was received in the company of the accused in the name of providing consultancy by the entities from INX Media, it said.The agency alleged that the total proceeds of crime laundered over a period of time in this case are Rs 65.88 crore.The money was routed to overseas accounts and investment was made in various overseas properties and shares of companies through various shell companies directly or indirectly controlled by Karti P Chidambaram and through his confidants, it alleged.The ED had filed a charge sheet in this case in 2021 in which it said that emails were recovered from seized digital devices that disclose Karti used to consult his father regarding matters related to a company -Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL) - beneficially owned by him in the past and involved in this case."

Instead, anyone getting a Pfizer or Moderna shot will receive the newer omicron-targeted version. For most people, if it’s their first-ever vaccine, just one combo dose will be enough."

The Narendra Modi government has taken the dishonoring of the Indian national flag by separatists very seriously.According to inputs received from Delhi Police, the Home Ministry handed over the investigations to NIA on April 13 after the Special Cell registered a case on the incident on March 23 on the basis of a complaint filed by a London High Commission official present during the time of violence. A case under sections 109147148149120-B448452325 IPC read with Section 13 of UAPA, Section 3(1) of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and section 2 of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 has been registered by the NIA on the same lines as the Delhi Police. Two officials of the Indian High Commission in London sustained grievous injuries during the violence by Sikh radicals.The Delhi Police FIR names Sikh extremist Avtar Singh aka Khanda, Gurcharan Singh and Jasvir Singh as the principal suspects as also the London High Commission made a SOS call to Diplomatic Protection Officer at 345 hours GMT about the breach in the Indian premises by radicals on March 19. The FIR clearly mentions that 50-60 separatists were led by Khanda (who has an Indian passport number F8777***) and yellow turban wearing Gurcharan Singh. Both of these extremists along with Jasvir Singh were recognized by the London High Commission official as taking part in the violence and dishonoring of the Indian Flag. It was Khanda and Gurcharan Singh who instigated the mob to vandalize the High Commission, dishonored the flag and inflicted grievous injuries to the High Commission officials while there was no response from the London Metropolitan Police.While the UK government has tried to dismiss the dishonoring of the Indian National Flag by Sikh extremists as part of their right to protest and freedom of speech, the Narendra Modi government has taken the incident as a barometer of its future relations with the British Government. The Modi government wants strict visible action to be taken against those named in the FIR as Khanda’s parents were both part of the ISI sponsored terrorist movement in Punjab in the 1990s. Khanda’s father was a KLF terrorist named Kulwant Singh Khukrana and mother was related to KLF leader Gurjant Singh Budhsinghwala with close connections to Pakistani deep state. Khanda entered Britain on a student visa and now seeks political asylum from the UK government for himself and others by raising human rights violations against his community in India.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

Khanda had pulled down the Tricolour at the mission. He is also learnt to have trained fugitive Khalistani sympathiser Amritpal Singh . An expert in explosives, Khanda has sought UK asylum.“The central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the National Investigation Agency Act , 2008, has been committed. The gravity of the offence and its national and international linkages require that it is probed by the NIA,” the order states. Khanda and his associate, Gurcharan Singh , had allegedly instigated a mob of 50-60 to vandalise the mission, dishonor the National Flag hoisted inside the complex and grievously injure officials."

It happened a day after the Punjab Police launched a crackdown against radical preacher Amritpal Singh in Punjab.The Counter-Terrorism and Counter Radicalisation unit of the Ministry of Home Affairs handed over the case to the NIA and the decision was taken after Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla held a meeting with representatives of the British government last week.In the London incident, the tricolour flying atop the Indian High Commission was grabbed at by a group of protesters waving separatist Khalistani flags and chanting pro-Khalistani slogans, leading to an arrest.Officials from the mission said the attempted but failed attack had been foiled and that the tricolour was now flying grander. The Metropolitan Police said two members of security staff sustained minor injuries which did not require hospital treatment.India had summoned the British deputy high commissioner based in New Delhi and demanded an explanation over the complete absence of security.Also Read | Diaspora gathers in solidarity outside Indian High Commission in LondonIn a strongly-worded statement, the Ministry of External Affairs had said India finds unacceptable the indifference of the U.K. government to the security of Indian diplomatic premises and personnel.Union Home Secretary Bhalla flagged the issue with a U.K. delegation which was led by Permanent Secretary, Home Office, Sir Matthew Rycroft and specifically conveyed New Delhi's concerns on the misuse of U.K.'s asylum status by pro-Khalistani elements to abet terrorist activities and requested better cooperation, increased monitoring of extremists and take proactive action.India's concerns over the breach of security at the Indian High Commission were also emphasised in that meeting."

It is posing a serious health risk to children as well as parents who go to pick up the kids and get exposed to the heat, said Sasmita Sahu, a parent.A parents' association said when the government is advising labourers not to work at 11 am, how can children be allowed to return home when the sun is at the peak?Not all children are commuting in school buses. Apart from 1% to 2 % children in cities, most children in rural and interior areas walk or ride a cycle to school. So, it has become very necessary to revise the timings, said Basudev Bhatt, chairman of Odisha Abhibhabak Mahasangha.After a brief summer break of five days from April 12 to 16, students returned to school on Monday. However, attendance of children was thin in most schools on the first day. For instance, only four children were present in Class X at Government Nodal High School, Powerhouse Square.Of the 20 kids I have in my anganwadi, only one child has come, said Malati Pradhan, an anganwadi supervisor in the city.The parents said though it is important to complete the syllabus on time, children's health should not be put at risk. After returning from school, my child is feeling dehydrated and exhausted. I don't think he will be able to go to school tomorrow. When I went to pick him up from school, it felt like fire raining from the sky. We are requesting the government to reconsider the school timings, said Manoranjan Swain, a parent.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said Bhubaneswar recorded 31.6 degrees Celsius at 8.30 am on Monday which climbed to 39.9 degrees Celsius later in the day. Baripada recorded the highest temperature in the state at 44.6 degrees Celsius.It is better to hold classes from 6 am to 9.30am or 10am maximum, said Brahmananda Moharana, president of Primary School Teachers' Association."

In these two states, the temperature is expected to rise by 4.5 degrees Celsius to 6.5 degrees Celsius, more than the average, for the next two days, the weather office said.India logged its hottest February this year since record-keeping began in 1901, according to the IMD. However, above-normal rainfall due to seven western disturbances, including five strong ones, kept temperatures in check in March.Speaking to NDTV, IMD senior scientist Dr Naresh said, We have to see the data of 30 to 40 years to review whether climate change has an effect or not. It is true that temperatures are rising globally but there is a difference in the temperature every year.Last year, there was a very strong heatwave in March-April. The reason for this was that western disturbance did not come. When the weather is dry then the temperature rises, he added.Several parts of India are forecast to witness hotter-than-usual weather through June.If we talk about March this year, all the western disturbances that came, gave rain only to Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. The plains remained dry and the temperature was abnormal, Dr Naresh said.A western disturbance, also known as an extra-tropical storm originating in the Mediterranean Sea is an area of low pressure that brings sudden showers, snow, and fog. They bring moderate to heavy rain in low-lying areas. Nearly 5 to 10 per cent of India's annual rainfall is thought to be a result of western disturbances.In 2015, the western disturbance was very active and there were heavy rain and hailstorm in many parts of the country from the third week of February to the first week of March, Dr Naresh said.Yesterday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 40.6 degrees Celsius, marking the third day in a row when the maximum temperature in the national capital settled above 40 degrees Celsius.Long-term study is needed to determine whether the change in weather is due to climate change, Dr Naresh added. There is a possibility of change in the weather every year."

                            "summary": "By Srishti Ojha, Nalini Sharma: The Centre and Gujarat will likely challenge a previous Supreme Court order that sought files on the premature release of convicts in the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case. Gujarat sought not to produce the files citing privilege and said it might file a plea seeking review of the court’s order.This came after the Supreme Court today sought to know from the Gujarat government why it allowed the premature release of the convicts. A bench of Justice KM Joseph and BV Nagarathna heard the case.advertisementThe bench remarked that the way the offence was committed was horrendous and said that the convicts were released on parole of over 1,000 days.The court observed that Bilkis Bano was pregnant when she was gang raped and it cannot be compared with a standard Section 302 (murder) case.“Will you compare oranges and apples? Will you compare the murder of a single person with the murder of more than 10 people? Just like you cannot compare apples with oranges, a massacre cannot be compared with a single murder. The trial had to be shifted to another state,” the bench said.Also Read | Supreme Court hears pleas for recognition of same-sex marriage: Key takeawaysAsking Gujarat and the Centre to produce the files relating to the remission, the court stressed the need for objective standards in deciding such cases.“Today it is this lady. Tomorrow it could be someone else. What happens to my brothers and sisters is definitely of great concern. There must be objective standards,” Justice Joseph said.The bench orally observed that the powers officers have can’t be used except for the public good, and several factors must be considered while granting remissions.One thing you can’t run away from is the Wednesbury principle. No officer can use his power except for the public good. Public welfare is what he must have in mind. When you give remission, the only ground is not just particulars, but also the public. There are other concerns. It's not a rights-based approach alone. Finally, what is the message you will be sending? Justice KM Joseph asked.Gujarat, however, told the top court that it is mulling options and will likely challenge the court’s earlier order calling for the files of remission granted to the convicts.Also Read | Bilkis Bano case convict seen sharing stage with BJP MP, MLA at Gujarat eventOn September 9, 2022, the Supreme Court asked Gujarat to place on record documents concerning the remission granted to 11 convicts sentenced to life imprisonment in the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case.advertisementThe court was informed by the Union and the Gujarat governments that they might file a plea seeking review of the Supreme Court’s order directing them to be ready with relevant files of remission granted in the case.The court was informed by Additional Solicitor General SV Raju that the file is ready, but both governments wish to file applications seeking a review of the order directing the state and the Centre to be ready with the files.However, it hasn’t been fully decided whether the petition seeking a review will be filed. The government sought not to produce the files on grounds of privilege.Also Read | Full emergency at Delhi airport as Air India plane lands with cracked windshieldWhile the Court rapped the government, saying that refusal to show files would amount to contempt of the court's order, it later observed that the government can exercise its legal remedy.The Supreme Court said if files are not shown to the court, it will have to draw its own conclusion. Further, if the government has done something perfectly legal, then they have nothing to fear, it said.Responding to a request for adjournment made on behalf of one of the accused, the court remarked that it’s aware of the strategy where the accused will try and seek time at every hearing. We are conscious of the fact that every hearing one accused will start saying they need time to reply. We are aware of that strategy also, Justice Nagarathna said.advertisementThe court, however, granted time to the accused to file their replies, observing that it’s their liberty which is at stake in the present case.The case will be heard next on May 2.Also Read | Bilkis Bano case: SC issues notice on pleas challenging premature release of 11 convicts"

She said the remission of sentence has shaken the conscience of society. Seven members of her family, including her three-year-old daughter, were also murdered in the 2002 Gujarat riots.The Supreme Court on March 27 told the Gujarat government and the centre to show the files used in the remission of sentence.A bench of Justices KM Joseph and BV Nagarathna questioned the remission granted to the 11 convicts during their incarceration period and said the gravity of the offence could have been considered by the state.A pregnant woman was gang-raped and several people were killed. You cannot compare victim's case with standard Section 302 (murder of Indian Penal Code) cases. Like you cannot compare apples with oranges, similarly massacre cannot be compared with single murder. Crimes are generally committed against society and the community. Unequals cannot be treated equally, the Supreme Court said, news agency PTI reported.The question is whether the government applied its mind and what material formed the basis of its decision to grant remission, the Supreme Court said. Today it is Bilkis but tomorrow it can be anyone. It may be you or me. If you do not show your reasons for grant of remission, then we will draw our own conclusions, it said.The Supreme Court will hear a clutch of requests challenging the remission to the convicts on May 2. It ordered all the convicts who have not been served notice to send their replies.On March 27, the Supreme Court termed the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case and the murder of her family members a horrendous act and questioned the Gujarat government whether uniform standards, as followed in other cases of murder, were applied while granting remission to the 11 convicts.Ms Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was gang-raped while fleeing the riots that broke out after the Godhra train burning incident.Last month, one of the 11 men who is after the remission of his sentence was seen sharing stage with a BJP MP and an MLA at a government programme in Gujarat."

                            "summary": "The central and Gujarat governments on Tuesday, claimed privilege before the Supreme Court over the files related to grant of remission to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case.They said they are likely to seek review of the court’s order to explain the reasons behind its decision to allow release of the life term convicts on remission in the case related to gang rape of the woman and killings of her family members.A bench of Justices K M Joseph and B V Nagarathna, however, said that when the crime in question was heinous and horrendous, it is imperative for the state government to show the application of mind.Read | Gujarat government's reply in Bilkis Bano case very bulky: SCWhy fight shy and not show the remission files to the court, the bench asked the state government counsel.The question is whether government applied its mind, what material formed the basis of its decision, even though there was an order requiring convicts to be in jail for rest of their natural life, yet they were released by executive order, the bench said.Today it is this lady (Bilkis). Tomorrow, it can be you or me. There must be objective standards...If you don't give us reason, we will draw our own conclusions, the bench told the counsel.Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, representing Centre, submitted that the files came to him on Tuesday.Let me look at the file and I will come back next week,” he said.The bench then told Raju, “You have done a perfectly legal thing, nothing to fear…..the grant of remission in ordinary cases will not be subjected to judicial review”.Raju said My instructions are, we are claiming privilege and asking for a review”.The bench, however, told him “You will be on a better footing if you show the files to us”.Raju insisted that his instructions are different and therefore he has to follow it.The bench said it has not stopped the government from filing for the review.Read | Bilkis Bano case convicts’ release: Two had open ‘outraging woman’s modesty case’, one missed paroleThe bench also asked in the absence of files, what will be the basis of the arguments of the government’s counsel.The bench also observed that a pregnant woman was gang-raped and several people were killed and the case cannot be compared with standard Section 302 (murder) IPC cases.“Like you cannot compare apples with oranges, similarly massacre cannot be compared with single murder. Crimes are generally committed against society and the community. Unequals cannot be treated equally, the bench said.Advocate Shobha Gupta, representing Bilkis Bano, said the state of Gujarat has already filed most of the documents in the court in the counter affidavit.The bench said the question is whether government applied its mind, what material formed the basis of its decision, etc.During the hearing, the bench also noted that virtually three years parole was granted to the convicts while they were serving the sentence.It also noted that more than 1,000 days parole was granted to each of them; one convict got 1,500 days parole.What policy have you been following, the bench asked.The court fixed the matter for further hearing on May 2 on the pleas filed by Bilkis Bano and others including former CPM MP Subhashini Ali, challenging premature release of the convicts."

The bench posted the batch of pleas challenging the remission to the convicts in Bilkis Bano case for final disposal on May 2. (AP Photo)A bench of Justices K M Joseph and B V Nagarathna questioned the paroles granted to 11 convicts during their incarceration period and said the gravity of the offence could have been considered by the state.It said, A pregnant woman was gang-raped and several people were killed. You cannot compare victim's case with standard section 302 (murder) cases. Like you cannot compare apples with oranges, similarly massacre cannot be compared with single murder. Crimes are generally committed against society and the community. Unequals cannot be treated equally.The question is whether government applied its mind and what material formed the basis of its decision to grant remission, the bench said, adding, “Today it is Bilkis but tomorrow it can be anyone. It may be you or me. If you do not show your reasons for grant of remission, then we will draw our own conclusions.The bench posted the batch of pleas challenging the remission to the convicts in Bilkis Bano case for final disposal on May 2 and asked all the convicts who have not been served notices to file their replies.It asked the Centre and the state to make its stand clear about filing of a review plea.On March 27, terming Bilkis Bano's gang-rape and the murder of her family members during the 2002 Godhra riots as a horrendous act, the Supreme Court had asked the Gujarat government whether uniform standards, as followed in other cases of murder, were applied while granting remission to the 11 convicts in the case.It had sought a response from the Centre, Gujarat government and others on a plea filed by Bilkis Bano, who was gang-raped and seven members of her family were killed during the 2002 post-Godhra riots.Bano has challenged the remission of sentence of 11 convicts in the case.All the 11 convicts were granted remission by the Gujarat government and released on August 15 last year.The top court is seized of PILs filed by CPI(M) leader Subhashini Ali, Revati Laul, an independent journalist, Roop Rekha Verma, who is a former vice chancellor of the Lucknow University, and TMC MP Mahua Moitra against the release of the convicts.Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was gang-raped while fleeing the riots that broke out after the Godhra train burning incident. Her three-year-old daughter was among the seven family members killed."

When he was toppled in April 2019 in a mass uprising, many hoped that the resource-rich country in the Horn of Africa would finally get a chance to move towards a freer society with a representative and responsive administration. But the tragedy of Sudan is that the monstrous regime that Mr. Bashir built outlasted his reign. Within two years of his fall, the military was back, and now, a power struggle between the top two generals has pushed Sudan to the brink of a civil war. Dozens of civilians have already been killed in fighting that broke out on Saturday in Khartoum and other parts of the country between the military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a notorious paramilitary group. Despite international calls for truce, Lt.Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the military chief as well as the head of the Sovereignty Council, the transitional administration, and his deputy, Lt.Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who commands the RSF, have refused to negotiate, blaming each other for the attacks. Mr. Dagalo, who has close ties with Russia’s Wagner private military company and Saudi Arabia, claims that the RSF has taken control of the presidential palace and has vowed to bring Gen. Burhan to justice, while the military has dismissed such claims and launched air strikes against RSF sites.Just two years ago, the two generals stood hand in hand when they ousted a civilian transition government and took over the reins of the country. Faced with international isolation and domestic pressure, they agreed to transfer power back to the civilians. But differences emerged on who should control the post-transition military. Gen. Burhan supports the integration of the RSF into the regular military and transition to civilian government to take place in two years, while Gen. Dagalo, who fears that he would lose his clout, wants to delay it by 10 years. Discord grew into mistrust and mistrust led to fighting. And the fighting could drag the country, which has a history of internal strife, into an all-out civil war. Sudan’s generals are known for their scant regard for the welfare of their people. The country is struggling with an economic crisis, with rocketing inflation and a burning hunger problem. The last thing Sudan wants now is a civil war. If the priority of the generals is to address Sudan’s basic problems, they should pay attention to the call for a truce and dialogue, and commit themselves to a timeline-sensitive democratic transition. Decades of military rule in Sudan have resulted in a lot of atrocities. Generals Burhan and Dagalo should not tread the same course."

                            "summary": "The conflict in Sudan is an internal power struggle, with its roots in the country’s troubled politics over recent decades.Four days of fighting has pitted army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional governing sovereign council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council. Their power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict.At the same time, a dozen or more regional powers, major actors in the Middle East and geo-political heavyweights have a stake in the fighting raging in Khartoum and elsewhere.The United States, which is the biggest actor, is able to exert influence directly on key individuals, through the withholding or delivery of huge sums of aid, its weight in international forums such as the United Nations or multilateral lenders, and its ability to build coalitions of smaller powers. The US wants stability in a restive region of enormous strategic importance, and also to roll back the growing influence of competitors such as China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. Washington welcomed the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has been criticised for taking too soft a line with the two main military powerbrokers and particularly with Burhan.China has been making a major effort to win friends in east Africa through the construction of major infrastructure, economic investment, loans and support for incumbent rulers who are attracted to its brand of authoritarianism. But although China has ambitions to establish a role as a mediator of consequence across the continent, it is unlikely to have much influence on this conflict. This relative neutrality at least gives Beijing the opportunity to build a relationship with any eventual victor.In contrast, Russia is seen as being fully committed to Hemedti and the RSF. The former warlord has been linked to Russian efforts to extract huge amounts of gold from Sudan to help fund the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has deployed Wagner group paramilitaries to bolster Hemedti’s operations. Beyond the precious resources, it is Sudan’s strategic position that has attracted Moscow, particularly the chance to position a major naval base there, which would allow operations in the Indian Ocean.Egypt has longstanding ties with Sudan’s military and has made its support for Burhan clear. Egyptian soldiers – or “trainers” – have been taken captive by the RSF in recent days. Cairo wants stability and likes the idea of an authoritarian military man in charge of its vast neighbour. But it also wants the support of Khartoum in its bitter argument with Ethiopia over the control of the flow of the Nile. The Egyptians also want to check the influence of their regional rivals in Sudan.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also major actors, and their rulers have personal relationships with many of the key figures in Sudan. Both have poured huge sums of money into Sudan since 2019 in an attempt to build a regime favourable to their interests. Hemedti won favour by dispatching thousands of Sudanese fighters to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition there, but Burhan has been welcomed too. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become much more aligned with western policy in Sudan in recent years. In recent weeks, Riyadh in particular has been active in trying to avert conflict – though without much success, it appears.The European Union is aligned with the US and the United Kingdom in seeking a compromise agreement that would lead to a transition to civilian control. Chaos in Sudan could trigger a new increase in refugees, and France is particularly concerned about the consequences for fragile states farther west where it has already lost much influence in recent years."

However, members of the staff persuaded him to have more shots. He was given two dozen powerful shots before he collapsed and later died. After he collapsed, staff at the club robbed him of 2,200 Polish złoty (Rs 42,816) in cash.As per Polish authorities, he had a blood alcohol content of at least 0.4 percent at the time of his death. Notably, alcohol poisoning can occur with a blood alcohol level of 0.3 percent or higher.The incident happened in 2017, but the Polish police recently charged 58 people with being part of organised crime group in connection with the tourist's death. They also filed over 700 criminal charges against the group as they conducted a raid on a number of nightclubs.They said, One of the leads investigated by the investigators in the case concerns the victim who was driven to a state of intoxication, causing loss of consciousness, and then death as a result of acute alcohol poisoning. The man was not given medical assistance during the incident. Provisional arrests were made against those suspected of this act."

The European Union needs to start talking about peace.This echoed a line frequently used by Moscow and Beijing, which blame the West for the war, which began in February 2022 when Russian forces poured into Ukraine in an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government and annex swaths of the pro-Western country.Brazil has not joined Western nations in imposing sanctions on Russia and has refused requests to supply ammunition to Ukraine.On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Brazil, at the start of a Latin America tour, that Russia is grateful to our Brazilian friends for their clear understanding of the genesis of the situation (in Ukraine).Veteran leftist Lula is keen to bolster Brazil's bid to be a non-aligned peacemaker.But Kirby said Lula's message on the war was deeply problematic.Washington doesn't have any objection to any country that wants to try to bring an end to the war, he said.Obviously we want the war to end, Kirby said. That could happen right now, today, if Mr (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would stop attacking Ukraine and pull its troops out.The most recent comments by Brazil that Ukraine should consider formally ceding Crimea as a peace concession is simply misguided, especially for a country like Brazil that has voted to uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity (at the UN).(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

                            "summary": "Ukraine’s government has criticised Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his efforts to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, and invited the Brazilian leader to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion.The comments came a day after Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, visited Brasília, and praised Lula’s calls for a negotiated settlement.A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Kyiv was watching Lula’s efforts to resolve the conflict “with interest” but criticised the Brazilian government for giving equal weight to “the victim and the aggressor”.The spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, confirmed that Lula had been invited to visit Kyiv “to understand the real causes of Russian aggression and its consequences for global security”.Lula has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine and suggested that Brazil could lead a “peace club” of neutral countries to mediate discussions between the two sides, as part of his efforts to return the South American country to international relevance after the isolation of the Jair Bolsonaro years.A non-aligned approach is coherent with Brazil’s longstanding foreign policy tradition of peace and cooperation. But the west increasingly views Brazil’s neutrality in the war as skewed towards Russia.“If you want to be taken seriously as a peace broker in this conflict, you need to visit both sides. Not only Russia,” said Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center thinktank.Last month, Lula’s top foreign policy adviser, Celso Amorim, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss prospects for peace and organise Lavrov’s visit to Brasília.Speaking on Monday alongside his Brazilian counterpart, Mauro Vieira, Lavrov praised Brazil’s efforts for peace talks and expressed gratitude for its “understanding of the genesis of the situation”.There have been no such bilateral encounters with Ukrainian officials and Washington rebuked Lula for hosting Lavrov.The US national security council spokesman, John Kirby, accused Brazil on Monday of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts”.Lula had ruffled feathers with comments over the weekend suggesting both sides were responsible for the conflict, and that the US and the European Union were not committed to pursuing peace.“Europe and the US end up contributing to the continuation of this war,” Lula said from Abu Dhabi on Sunday, having said a day earlier in Beijing that the US must “stop encouraging the war”.Lula’s state visit to China last week, part of his diplomatic reset, will have further irked officials in Washington in light of growing international tensions.Brazil’s foreign minister Vieira rejected the White House’s criticism. “I don’t agree at all,” he told journalists on Monday."

The meeting took place amid the West criticising Lula's recent remarks on the defence support for Ukraine from the United States.During his China visit, Lula had said that the US needs to stop encouraging the war and said that the West needs to start talking about peace.Lavrov praised Lula's efforts in attempting to end the war by urging to promote of diplomatic channels to de-escalate the conflict. Before starting his visit, Lula had proposed creating a group of countries to mediate in the war. He had even said that he would discuss it with Beijing, but there was no update on the same.ALSO READ | Russian strikes kill father and daughter in Ukraine's ZaporizhzhiaWhile mentioning the interest to end the war and the conflict, Lavrov reiterated Russia's stance that any diplomatic solution must acknowledge the realities of its unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian provinces.Lavrov said, We are interested in the Ukrainian conflict ending as soon as possible. We have already announced in detail the reasons for what is happening and the very goals that we are pursuing in this regard.They consist primarily in guaranteeing the absence of any threats to the military security of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine, and the West has been implementing such plans for many years. And the second task, of course, is to protect the lives and legal rights of the Russian-speaking population of the east and south of Ukraine, he added.Meanwhile, Ukraine has often said that for it, the true meaning of peace would include Kyiv taking back Crimea and Russia giving up the occupied regions.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said last week: Real peace means restoring the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Real peace means a safe homeland for the targeted people in the Ukrainian Crimea.(With inputs from agencies)WATCH WION LIVE HERE"

Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang. (AFP)Qin held separate phone calls with Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al-Maliki, and his Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, during which he spoke about “steps to resume peace talks”, telling the former that China was “willing to play an active role in this regard” and conveying to the latter that “China is ready to provide convenience for this”.“China encourages both Israel and Palestine to show political courage and take steps to resume peace talks, and China is ready to provide convenience for this,” Qin, who is also state councillor, said Monday, according to the official news agency, Xinhua.“All parties should maintain calm and restraint, and stop excessive and provocative words and deeds,” Qin told Cohen, adding that the “…fundamental way out is to resume peace talks and implement the ‘two-state solution’.”Qin told Maliki China “supports the strategic autonomy of Middle Eastern countries”, adding that China is willing to continue to make contributions to peace and stability in the Middle East.Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have been stalled since 2014 and this month has witnessed renewed violence and deaths in the region, heightening tension even as Tel Aviv grapples with large-scale domestic protests.Qin reiterated to Maliki that China is highly concerned about the recent intensification of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the escalation of tensions.China, he said, has urged the “UN Security Council to hold consultations and communicate closely with the international community to try to cool down the situation”.“China has no selfish interests on the Israel-Palestine issue, and only hopes that Israel and Palestine can coexist peacefully and safeguard regional peace and stability,” Qin told Cohen.Beijing is projecting itself as an international broker of peace after bringing hostile Tehran and Riyadh together for talks.The foreign ministers from the two countries met in Beijing earlier this month for the first formal gathering of their top diplomats. Iran is said to have reopened its embassy in Saudi Arabia earlier this month for the first time in seven years.Qin made it a point to mention that as well in his phone call with Cohen, saying Saudi Arabia and Iran recently “…restored diplomatic relations through dialogue, setting a good example of overcoming differences through dialogue”.China floated the 12-point peace proposal, titled “China’s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis” in February but has so far failed to stop Russia’s invasion of the East European country.In fact, Beijing’s close ties with Moscow means that it will not be seen as – or expected to be – a neutral player to broker a peace deal despite its assertions of neutrality in the conflict.There’s also the wider Western concern that China could soon supply lethal weapons to ally Russia under their “no limits friendship”.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

Clashes at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem earlier this month drew condemnation from Arab countries across the region. Saudi Arabia, with whom Israel hopes to normalise ties, said Israel’s “storming” of al-Aqsa undermined peace efforts.This year’s overlap of Ramadan and Passover increases the possibility of friction as the city hosts an unusually large influx of pilgrims.Qin is reported to have told his Israeli counterpart that China is “concerned about the current tension between Israel and Palestine, and the current top priority is to bring the situation under control and prevent the conflict from escalating or even getting out of control.”China has been on a recent diplomatic offensive, brokering the restoration of ties in March between Iran and Saudi Arabia – rivals in a region where the United States for decades has been the main diplomatic powerbroker.“Saudi Arabia and Iran recently restored diplomatic relations through dialogue, setting a good example of overcoming differences through dialogue,” Qin said.That deal is likely to have major ramifications on the Yemen Civil War, where both sides are locked in a proxy war.In February, Beijing produced a peace plan for Ukraine after talks between president Xi Jinping and Russsia’s Vladimir Putin. It urged all parties to avoid nuclear escalation but critically did not suggest Russia withdraw its forces.While western leaders largely dismissed the proposal, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy cautiously welcomed the plan, but said it would only be acceptable if it led to Putin pulling his troops out from all occupied Ukrainian territory."

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 08:22 am | Updated 05:37 pm IST - KARUIZAWA, JapanTop diplomats from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies vowed a tough stance on China’s increasing threats to Taiwan and on North Korea's unchecked tests of long-range missiles, while building momentum on ways to boost support for Ukraine and punish Russia for its invasion.Russia’s war in Ukraine consumed much of the agenda on April 17 for the envoys gathered in this Japanese hot spring resort town for talks meant to pave the way for action by G-7 leaders when they meet next month in Hiroshima.The world is at “turning point” on the fighting in Ukraine and must “firmly reject unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and its threats of the use of nuclear weapons,” Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told his colleagues, according to a Japanese summary.For the American delegation, the meeting comes at a crucial moment in the world’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and efforts to deal with China, two issues that G-7 ministers from Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and the European Union regard as potent challenges to the post-World War II rules-based international order.A senior U.S. official traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the Biden administration’s goal for the talks is to shore up support for Ukraine, including a major initiative on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure launched at last year’s G-7 gatherings in Germany, as well as to ensure the continued provision of military assistance to Kyiv.Ramping up punishment against Russia, particularly through economic and financial sanctions that were first threatened by the G-7 in December 2021, before the invasion, will also be a priority, the official said.Ukraine faces an important moment in coming weeks with Russia’s current offensive largely stalled and Ukraine preparing a counteroffensive. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Blinken’s priorities at the closed-door meetings, said there would be discussion about ways to deepen support for Ukraine’s long-term defense and deterrence capabilities. That might also improve Kyiv’s position for potential negotiations that could end the conflict on its terms.The role of Japan — the only Asian member of the G-7 — as chairman of this year's talks provides an opportunity to discuss coordinated action on China. Leaders and foreign ministers of G-7 countries, most recently France and Germany, have recently concluded visits to China, and the diplomats in Karuizawa are expected to discuss their impressions of where the Chinese stand on numerous issues, including the war in Ukraine, North Korea, and Taiwan, which is a particular sore point in U.S.-Chinese relations.At a private working dinner on Sunday night that was the diplomats’ first formal meeting, Hayashi urged continued dialogue with China on the many global challenges where participation from Beijing is seen as crucial. Among the Chinese interests that are intertwined with those of wealthy democracies are global trade, finance and climate efforts.But the diplomats are also looking to address China’s more aggressive stance in the region, particularly toward Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own.Mr. Hayashi told Ministers that outside nations must continue “building a constructive and stable relationship, while also directly expressing our concerns and calling for China to act as a responsible member of the international community,” according to a summary of the closed-door dinner.China recently sent planes and ships to simulate an encirclement of Taiwan. Beijing has also been rapidly adding nuclear warheads, taking a tougher line on its claim to the South China Sea and painting a scenario of impending confrontation.The worry in Japan can be seen it its efforts to make a major break from its self-defense-only post-World War II principles, working to acquire preemptive strike capabilities and cruise missiles to counter growing threats.Mr. Blinken had been due to visit Beijing in February, but the trip was postponed because of a Chinese spy balloon incident over U.S. airspace and has yet to be rescheduled.Mr. Blinken met briefly with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Forum, but high-level contacts between Washington and Beijing have become rare. Thus, Blinken will be seeking insight from his French and German counterparts on their interactions with the Chinese, the senior U.S. official said.Despite indications, notably comments from French President Emmanuel Macron, that the G-7 is split over China, the official said there is shared worry among G-7 nations over China’s actions. The official added that the foreign ministers would be discussing how to continue a coordinated approach to China.Another senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door meetings, said the G-7 would release a communique Tuesday that would make clear the group’s strong unity over Russia’s war in Ukraine, China and the broader Indo-Pacific, particularly North Korea, the need to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, and to improve relations with Pacific island nations.The official downplayed suggestions that fissures are emerging over China. G-7 members, the official said, want to work with China on common challenges, but will “stand up” against Chinese coercion and attempts to water down or circumvent international rules regarding trade and commerce.The official said that in numerous recent diplomatic engagements with Chinese officials, G-7 members had stressed to Beijing that any supply of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine would be met with serious consequences, as would attempts to change the status quo of Taiwan. The official said that European members now have a better understanding of how a “roiling” of the status quo would affect their interests, notably their economies.North Korea is also a key area of worry for Japan and other neighbors in the region.Since last year, Pyongyang has test-fired around 100 missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that showed the potential of reaching the U.S. mainland and a variety of other shorter-range weapons that threaten South Korea and Japan.Mr. Hayashi “expressed grave concern over North Korea’s launch of ballistic missiles with an unprecedented frequency and in unprecedented manners, including the launch in the previous week, and the G-7 Foreign Ministers strongly condemned North Korea’s repeated launches of ballistic missiles,” according to the summary."

                            "summary": "Ukraine Peace Plan‘China Nuclear Threat’The Group of Seven nations vowed to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” in its fight against Russian forces, while also calling for greater engagement with China to stabilize relations with the world’s second-biggest economy.In a communique released Tuesday after top G-7 diplomats met in Japan, the bloc condemned Russia’s war against Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms.” The nations reiterated support for Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy ’s peace plan, while slamming Russia’s “irresponsible nuclear rhetoric.”“We recommit today to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and to providing sustained security, economic, and institutional support to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression,” the statement said.The G-7 ministers also said they recognized the importance of “engaging candidly” with China and the need to work together on common interests, while calling for a “peaceful resolution” of Taiwan-related issues. It also expressed concern about China’s growing nuclear arsenal and called for talks with the US on arms control.The ministers added that there was “no change in the basic positions of the G-7 members on Taiwan, including stated one-China policies” — pushing back on Beijing’s claims that the US in particular is seeking to change the status quo.The language on China in the communique, notably softer than the heated rhetoric often heard in Washington, comes as the group seeks to project unity after key differences emerged following Emmanuel Macron’s recent trip to Beijing. The French leader said the European Union should avoid being dragged into a dispute with China by the US, remarks that helped advance Chinese President Xi Jinping ’s goal of stoking divisions between American allies.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who also attended the meetings in Japan, on Monday underscored that Germany wouldn’t compromise on its values when it comes to engaging with China.“I made clear in China: We want to cooperate, we want to be partners, but we are not naive,” she told reporters in Japan.During the meetings, which also included French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, diplomats agreed on an approach that emphasized trying to cooperate with Beijing wherever possibly, while de-risking their economic reliance on China and sending clear signals that Chinese weapon deliveries to Russia — as well as military escalation with Taiwan — would be unacceptable, an official familiar with the matter said.The US hasn’t had high-level meetings with Beijing since President Joe Biden met Xi late last year, as the shooting down of an alleged Chinese spy balloon prompted Blinken to cancel a long-planned trip to China. Ties only worsened following Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s unprecedented meeting on US soil with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which prompted China to launch military exercises.One key question has been the extent to which G-7 nations should engage with Xi’s vague peace blueprint for Ukraine, which has received backing from emerging economies in the so-called Global South.On a trip to Beijing last week, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters it was “important that the US stops encouraging war and starts talking about peace.” His government then invited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the South American country, where Brazil Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira criticized sanctions imposed by the US and its allies.While the US and its allies have dismissed any cease-fire proposal that would allow Russia to keep territorial gains, some countries like France have welcomed China’s effort to find a diplomatic resolution. The G-7 ministers endorsed Zelenskyy’s “Peace Formula,” which includes the complete withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.The G-7 has translated its close coordination on arming Ukrainian forces over the last year into a renewed dialogue on the challenges presented by China, a senior State Department official told reporters on Monday evening. The group sees the need to stay engaged with China while standing up against any coercive measures or efforts to change the status quo in Taiwan, the official said.Ahead of a G-7 leaders summit in Hiroshima next month, the foreign ministers also discussed how to provide critical infrastructure investments across the developing world in order to give countries a high-quality alternative to Chinese investments, the official said.The US has long sought to engage China in talks on its nuclear weapons, to no avail. Beijing in turn accuses the US of hyping up the “China nuclear threat” as an excuse to expand its own stockpile, saying that China maintains a defensive policy that includes no first-use of nuclear weapons and an arsenal at a minimum level for national security.“As the G-7 we shared concerns about China’s expanding nuclear arsenal and affirmed the importance of transparency,” Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday. “We strongly urged China to swiftly join talks with the US aimed at reducing strategic risks.”"

                            "summary": "Western leaders are preparing for Vladimir Putin to use “whatever tools he’s got left” including nuclear threats and cyber-attacks in response to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia.British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory.The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down.Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.G7 officials said there was an “open exchange of views” in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on “future prospects” for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table.However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job.Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support – including more tanks and fighter jets – the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its “rainy day fund”.A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support.The group said that “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington.At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to “intensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing” sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow.It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for “bravely” denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial.The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia’s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial.Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a “vassal” to the US on foreign policy.He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be “humiliated” and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin’s attempts to divide and conquer.Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe.In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market.The UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine."

                            "summary": "KARUIZAWA: Top diplomats from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies vowed a unified front against Chinese threats to Taiwan and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, saying at the close of their meetings Tuesday that they were committed to boosting and enforcing tough sanctions against Moscow.The G-7 communique laying out their commitments also included strong words over an unprecedented run of North Korean missile tests. But it was China's growing assertiveness in Asia and Russia's invasion of Ukraine that highlighted the three-day summit hosted by Japan in this hot springs resort town.There can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities such as Russia's attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure, the ministers said.We remain committed to intensifying sanctions against Russia, coordinating and fully enforcing them, the communique said, and would support for as long as it takes Ukraine as it defends itself.The foreign ministers' communique was prepared as a template for global leaders to use at a G-7 summit that will be held in Hiroshima next month, and included language about Iran, Myanmar, Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation and other grave threats.But two crises stood out: China's increasing threats against, and military maneuvers around, Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia's current offensive is largely stalled and Ukraine is preparing a counteroffensive, but there's widespread global worry about the Russian leader's repeated threats to use tactical nuclear weapons.Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its threat to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are unacceptable, the ministers said.The G-7 envoys from Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and the European Union have underlined that their meeting in Karuizawa marks a crucial moment in the world's response to Russian and Chinese aggression, two crises that are seen as challenges to the post-World War II rules-based international order. Global efforts to confront the matters at the United Nations have been stymied by Chinese and Russian intransigence on the Security Council.Leaders and foreign ministers of G-7 countries, most recently France and Germany, have recently concluded visits to China, and there is growing worry after China recently sent planes and ships to simulate an encirclement of Taiwan. Beijing has also been rapidly adding nuclear warheads, taking a tougher line on its claim to the South China Sea and painting a scenario of impending confrontation.The G-7 ministers said that peace and stability between China and Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait is an indispensable element in security and prosperity in the international community, and they called for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.On Taiwan, there is clear unanimity in the approach we are taking, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters of his talks with other ministers in Karuizawa.What I heard was a remarkable convergence on concerns related to (China) and what we're doing to address those concerns, he said.On stalled discussions with the Chinese, Blinken said the United States placed a premium on keeping communications channels open as President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to last year.My expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that, but it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that, Blinken said.The communique also urged China to abstain from threats, coercion, intimidation or the use of force. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region.Despite indications, notably comments from French President Emmanuel Macron , that the G-7 is split over China, US officials said in Karuizawa that there is a shared worry among G-7 nations over China's actions, and a desire to continue a coordinated approach on working with Beijing even as nations confront Chinese coercion and attempts to water down or circumvent international rules regarding trade and commerce.Japan's worry about China can be seen it its efforts to make a major break from its self-defense-only post-World War II principles, which include work to acquire preemptive strike capabilities and cruise missiles.For the first time as the G-7, we noted in a statement our commitment to a rules-based, free and open international order and our strong objection to unilateral attempts to change the status-quo anywhere in the world, Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.He said that Japan, as the only G-7 member in Asia, brought a focus to the Indo-Pacific region.Besides China, a key worry is North Korea, which since the beginning of last year has test-fired around 100 missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that showed the potential of reaching the US mainland and a variety of other shorter-range weapons that threaten South Korea and Japan.We demand North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or provocative actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology, the communique said, adding that future actions must be met with a swift, united and robust international response, including further significant measures to be taken by the UN Security Council.It is critical that sanctions be fully and scrupulously implemented by all states and remain in place for as long as North Korea's WMD (weapons of mass destruction) and ballistic missile programs exist, the ministers said."

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 01:25 pm | Updated 10:41 pm IST - KYIV, UkraineThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin had visited two frontline regions in Ukraine, prompting Kyiv to brand it a tour of the scenes of Russian crimes.Moscow portrayed the trip as a marker of its control in occupied Ukraine, but Russia does not fully hold those areas despite claiming them after a widely-condemned annexation.Mr. Putin's visit to Kherson and Lugansk, which was only made public a day after it happened, came as China's Defence Minister Li Shangfu was in Moscow to demonstrate what he called Beijing's determination to stronger Russia ties.Moscow has been seeking allies to confront the West as its war in Ukraine causes immense destruction and suffering but has not neared Mr. Putin's goal of capturing control of the country.The President is now visiting the new regions more and more often, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding it is absolutely important that Mr. Putin as supreme commander-in-chief of Russia's armed forces gets information on the spot.The Kremlin chief's February 2022 invasion triggered the largest conflict in Europe since World War II, with Ukrainian forces now expected to be preparing a spring counter-offensive.Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, called Mr. Putin's trip a 'special tour' of the mass murders' author, adding he went to Ukraine's occupied territories to enjoy the crimes of his minions for the last time.After Mr. Putin's visit was made public on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had shelled the centre of the city of Kherson, killing one person and injuring nine.Last week a Russian strike on a block of flats in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk killed 15, including a two-year-old boy, and wounded 24.Russia was beaten back in northern and southern regions last year and Moscow's forces have made only incremental gains in eastern Ukraine.Much of the fighting is now concentrated around the eastern town of Bakhmut which has become the longest and bloodiest battle of the conflict.During his trip to Ukraine, Mr. Putin met Russian military commanders and discussed the situation on several fronts of the pro-Western country, the Kremlin said.According to video footage released by the Kremlin, neither Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu nor Russia's top commander in Ukraine, Valery Gerasimov, accompanied Mr. Putin.Mr. Putin's spokesman Mr. Peskov said it was not rational for all the top military commanders to gather in one place and both Mr. Shoigu and Mr. Gerasimov participated in the meetings remotely.The footage showed Mr. Putin disembarking from a helicopter as he visited the headquarters of the Dnieper Army group in the Kherson region and heard a report from Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's airborne troops.He also visited national guard headquarters in Lugansk in eastern Ukraine and heard a report from Colonel-General Alexander Lapin.It's important for me to hear your opinion on the situation, to listen to you and to exchange information, Mr. Putin said in the video.The Kremlin said in March that Mr. Putin had made a surprise trip to the port city of Mariupol, which Moscow captured after a long siege last spring.In Moscow, Mr. Li told Mr. Shoigu his trip was aimed at demonstrating Beijing's determination to strengthen strategic ties with Russia.Mr. Shoigu said it was important that our countries see eye to eye on the issue of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape.British military intelligence said on Tuesday that heavy fighting continued along the Donbas front line in eastern Ukraine.However, there is a realistic possibility that Russia has reduced troop numbers and is decreasing offensive action around Donetsk city, most likely to divert resources towards the Bakhmut sector, it said in a statement.The statement said that in Bakhmut, Russia's regular troops and forces from the Wagner mercenary outfit continued to make creeping advances.Ukraine, the statement said, wants to free-up an offensive force while Russia likely aspires to regenerate an operational reserve.The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russian troops were not abandoning their goal of taking control of Bakhmut at any cost, ramping up the use of heavy artillery and air strikes.Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, for his part said that Russia currently had no offensive potential for a strategic offensive operation.The head of the Ukrainian President's office, Andriy Yermak, meanwhile said he spoke with U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan."

Additionally, a separate unsealed case in Washington charges Russian national Natalia Burlinova “with conspiring with an FSB officer to act as an illegal agent of Russia in the United States.”1h ago 17.34 BST The Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has said that the Black Sea grain deal faced the threat of being halted. “It is under threat of being halted and Russia has again blocked the inspection of ships,” Svyrydenko told a news conference in Warsaw. “It is extremely important for us to unblock transit, otherwise Ukraine will remain blocked. We cannot together with our partners give Russia the opportunity to take advantage of this situation,” she said. This follows the news that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to discuss the Black Sea grain deal with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to New York next week.2h ago 17.12 BST Poland has said that it has reached an agreement on restarting transit of Ukrainian grains through its territory as of Friday, according to Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus. Reuters reports: Pressure has been mounting on Brussels to work out a European Union-wide solution after Warsaw and Budapest announced bans on some imports from Ukraine at the weekend, with other countries in eastern Europe saying they are also considering action. Farmers say cheap imports from Ukraine, which has faced difficulties exporting by sea due to Russia’s invasion, have lowered prices and reduced their sales. In Poland, the issue has created a problem in an election year for the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that relies on rural areas for much of its support. Ukraine had said its priority was to reopen transit through Poland. “We managed to create such mechanisms that will ensure that not a single ton of grain will remain in Poland,” Telus told journalists after two days of talks in Warsaw.2h ago 16.43 BST Russia has warned that the outlook for the deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports beyond the 18 May is “not so great”. Reuters reports: “Of course, he will be raising that during his bilateral (meeting with Guterres),” Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian U.N. Ambassador told reporters. “Nothing is moving, efforts are being made but unfortunately they are fruitless for us,” he said, referring to U.N. attempts to help facilitate Russia’s own food and fertiliser exports despite broad Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over the invasion. “So far, no optimistic news ... We clearly said we want to see progress,” Nebenzia said. The grain export deal was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that U.N. officials said had been worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the most deadly war in Europe since World War Two. It was extended in November and then last month Russia only agreed to renew the deal for at least 60 days, half the intended period. Moscow said it would only consider a further extension if several demands in relation to its own exports were met. To help persuade Russia to allow Ukraine to resume Black Sea grain exports, a separate three-year pact was also struck in July in which the U.N. agreed to help Russia export food and fertiliser.3h ago 16.01 BST According to the TASS news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to discuss the Black Sea grain deal with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to New York next week. The Black Sea grain export deal was renewed for 60 days last month, but Russia has signalled it may not agree to extend it further unless the West removes what it says are obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertiliser.3h ago 15.30 BST Agence France-Presse in Stockholm reports that the maker of Sweden’s Absolut vodka has said it is ceasing all exports to Russia after calls to boycott the brand flared up in Sweden and on social media. The Absolut Company said it had “decided to stop the export of its brand to Russia”. Stephanie Durroux, the firm’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was exercising its “duty of care” towards its employees and partners. “We cannot expose them to massive criticism in all forms,” she added. Absolut’s owner, Pernod Ricard, confirmed earlier in April that it had resumed some exports to Russia after previously halting them in March 2022, soon after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The company noted that since November last year, Russia had changed importation regulations allowing for parallel imports of alcohol without the permission of authorised importers, thus bypassing the EU sanctions. Pernod Ricard stressed that the decision to resume exports was made in part to protect its staff in Russia from “criminal liability” and accusations of “intentional bankruptcy”.

The president heard reports from military commanders on the situation on the battlefield and handed out awards to soldiers. 01:23 Volodymyr Zelenskiy visits Ukrainian troops in Avdiivka – videoUpdated at 14.58 BST4h ago 14.40 BST Security concerns have prompted Russian authorities this year to cancel traditional nationwide victory day processions where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against Nazi Germany in the second world war, Reuters has reported a lawmaker as saying on Tuesday. Since 2012, the “immortal regiment” processions have become an important feature of national celebrations on 9 May, a public holiday when Russia honours the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the struggle to defeat Adolf Hitler’s invasion. But Tass news agency quoted the lawmaker Yelena Tsunayeva as saying the marches would not take place this year since a number of regions, including Russian-annexed Crimea, had pulled out “because of the threat”. Tsunayeva did not specify a threat, although Russia has claimed that Ukraine has been behind bomb attacks on Russian soil. Tass quotes Tsunayeva as saying: “This is still a single indivisible story, the immortal regiment procession, if somewhere people do not have such an opportunity, let’s use other options.” She said everyone was invited to post photos of their veteran relatives on social networks, on clothes, on a car and on the website of the movement.

Photograph: Maxim ShemetovReutersUpdated at 14.57 BST4h ago 14.29 BST Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that the ambassadors of the US, UK and Canada have been summoned to the foreign ministry over their comments about the sentencing yesterday of the opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza. Tass quotes the ministry saying: In connection with gross interference in the internal affairs of Russia and activities that do not correspond to diplomatic status, the ambassadors of the US, Britain and Canada have been summoned to the foreign ministry. The report also cites Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, saying she “stressed that Moscow considers unacceptable the statements of British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after the sentence of Kara-Murza and warned London against the politicisation of international human rights issues. Zakharova also called ‘the height of cynicism’ the demands of the US and Canadian ambassadors to release Kara-Murza, while in their homeland human rights are shamelessly violated and dissidents are persecuted.”Updated at 14.53 BST5h ago 14.13 BST Russia is “not yet” planning to block Wikipedia, its minister of digital affairs said on Tuesday as a Moscow court handed the online encyclopaedia another fine for failing to remove content Russia deems illegal. “We are not blocking Wikipedia yet, there are no such plans for now,” Interfax news agency quoted the digital affairs minister, Maksut Shadaev, as saying at a data forum in Moscow. Reuters reports that on Tuesday, Moscow’s Tagansky district dourt fined Wikipedia owner Wikimedia Foundation 800,000 roubles (£7,900$9,800) for what Russian news agencies said was a failure to remove information considered to be promoting train hopping, where a person rides on the side or top of a train. The Wikimiedia Foundation has previously been fined for failing to remove what Russian courts have deemed false information about the war in Ukraine.Updated at 14.54 BST5h ago 14.11 BST Russia’s leading opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, faces the prospect of new criminal charges, one of his lawyers has claimed. Reuters reports that Vadim Kobzev alleged on Twitter that authorities had provoked Navalny by placing another inmate in his cell, and that Navalny had been given no choice but to drag him out. He had then been told he would be charged with thwarting prison authorities, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, Kobzev said. The penitentiary service, which has in the past denied allegations of mistreatment, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.5h ago 14.07 BST Poland this month presented a proposal for a new set of sanctions against Russia for waging war against Ukraine, according to a document seen by Reuters on Tuesday, including a ban on pipeline oil and diamond imports. The written proposal, which a diplomatic source said was delivered to the EU executive European Commission, marks the opening of what is bound to be long and complex negotiations among the bloc’s 27 countries. All EU members must agree to impose new sanctions. The bloc has already put in place 10 rounds of punitive steps against Russia since Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Warsaw’s proposal would stop Russian oil imports via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline going to Germany. It would end imports of Russian diamonds and natural gas, including LNG, and curb nuclear energy cooperation. Germany and Lithuania are also for nuclear energy sanctions with leniency for those like Hungary and France who trade with Russia. Hungary, which last week said it had agreed to modify its contract with Russia’s Rosatom for the expansion of the Paks nuclear plant, has so far firmly opposed any sanctions on Russian nuclear energy. Belgium, home to the world’s biggest diamond trading hub Antwerp, has successfully lobbied against barring Russian imports so far.Updated at 14.17 BST5h ago 13.40 BST Shaun Walker A Russian judge has rejected an appeal by the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich against the decision to hold him in detention before his trial on charges of espionage. Gershkovich, 31, is the first US journalist to be detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the cold war and, if found guilty, could face up to 20 years in prison. Russia’s FSB security service has accused him of collecting state secrets about Russia’s military for the benefit of US intelligence, charges that have been roundly condemned as political and unfounded. Hearings in his case are being held in closed sessions because of the nature of the charges, but cameras were briefly allowed into the courtroom before Tuesday’s hearing started. The court was only deciding whether to hold Gershkovich in pre-trial detention, not on the substance of the case. It was the first time the outside world has seen proper footage of Gershkovich since his arrest at the end of March. The reporter was standing inside a glass case known informally as an “aquarium”, where defendants in Russian court cases are often held. He appeared calm and was pictured smiling. Marks on one of his wrists appeared to show where he had been kept in handcuffs.

Workers attacked the #Chinese engineer and chanted “Sar Tan se Juda,” he said in a tweet.On Sunday (April 16), Pakistan police arrested a Chinese engineer (named Mr Tian) working at a hydropower project in Kohistan District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on accusations of blasphemy. The Chinese national working in China Gezhouba Group Company was accused of ‘insulting’ Allah.According to South China Morning Post, Tian had allegedly commented about the slow pace of work during the Islamic holy month of Ramzan, which infuriated the Pakistani employees of the company.As the news of the argument and alleged blasphemy spread, a charged mob of several hundred people, chanting death threats against Tian, gathered outside the residential camp and began pelting it with stones.Sialkot mob lynching caseIn December 2021, a Sri Lankan man Priyantha Kumara was tortured and burnt to death by a murderous Islamist mob over rumours of blasphemy. The incident took place on Wazirabad Road in Sialkot in Pakistan, where the workers attacked the export manager of a factory and burnt his body after killing him.In a video, the frenzied mob could be heard chanting “Nara e Taqbeer” and “Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah”. Other slogans that were heard included ‘gustakh-e-nabi ki ek hi saza, sar tan se juda sar tan se juda’.Following diplomatic pressure from the Sri Lankan government, Pakistan was forced to act on the Islamists who killed Priyantha Kumara. With the help of CCTV footage, the police were able to apprehend 235 people for partaking in the heinous crime.According to reports, 900 workers of the Rajco Industries were booked under Sections 302, 297, 201, 427, 431, 157, 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Sections 7 and 11WW of the Anti-Terrorism Act."

                            "summary": "PeshawarBeijing, Apr 18 (PTI) An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sent a Chinese national to jail on a 14-day judicial remand on blasphemy charges in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after he was arrested on Monday, media reports said on Tuesday.The police arrested the Chinese national identified as Tian on Sunday and on Monday he was shifted to Abbottabad via an Army helicopter due to security concerns as the police feared local people could harm him.Tian was booked on blasphemy charges and sent to prison on a 14-day judicial remand by an Abbottabad anti-terrorism court on Monday, the Dawn newspaper reported.Under Pakistan’s tough blasphemy laws, the offence carries the death penalty.In Beijing, a concerned China on Tuesday said it is verifying the information that one of its engineers was arrested by police on Sunday amid a mob attack instigated by a group that accused him of blasphemy, an incident which could cast a shadow on all weather ties between the two countries.Considering the close relations with China, Pakistan has taken extraordinary precautions to protect the Chinese engineer by keeping him in a top security prison to avoid mob attacks, according to the media reports.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing in Beijing that “the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan is verifying the information”.“The Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals overseas to abide by laws and regulations of the host countries and respect local customs and traditions,” he said.“If the incident involves Chinese nationals, our Embassy will provide consular protection and assistance within the purview of its duty,” he told reporters in response to a question.The Chinese citizen, a manager at the Dasu Hydropower Project, the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, in the Upper Kohistan district of the province, allegedly made blasphemous remarks on Friday when the workers were going to perform the weekly prayer.According to local people, the Chinese manager complained to workers at the dam that “precious time” was being lost due to prayer breaks.The Dasu Hydropower Project is a major venture under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC).“We have arrested the foreigner suspect under blasphemy and terrorism charges and airlifted him from here to present him before the anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Abbottabad,” District Police Officer (DPO) Upper Kohistan, Mohammad Khalid, was quoted as saying in the report.The suspect was later produced before the ATC amid strict security measures. The DPO said the Chinese national was moved to Islamabad onboard a helicopter on Monday evening, the report said.The police registered a first information report (FIR) against Tian at the Dasu police station on Monday, hours after hundreds of residents and labourers working on the dam project blocked a key highway and rallied, demanding his arrest.According to the officer, police swung into action after getting reports on Sunday night that a local mob tried to break into a Chinese camp near the project site.The mob was controlled, but they assembled again on Monday and blocked the Karakoram Highway, which links Pakistan with China, in a protest that lasted for over six to seven hours, demanding the Chinese national’s arrest.The blocked highway was later reopened to traffic, and work resumed at the Dasu Dam after Tian’s arrest.Tian appeared before a tribal council, or jirga, on Monday, where his Pakistani interpreter alleged the Chinese national had used “abusive language against Allah and Prophet Mohammed” during a heated conversation with his accusers about time taken off to pray while on duty during Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, reports said.Tian denied the accusations and said he had been falsely accused.Meanwhile, in a bid to defuse the situation, a team of Ulema (Islamic scholars) from nearby towns and villages have set up a committee to examine the situation.The meeting was attended, among others, by Upper Kohistan Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsood and District Police Officer Mohammad Khalid.The participants urged the agitators not to take the law into their hands as police and the district administration were “handling the matter admirably”.Under pressure from the authorities, the jirga issued a proclamation warning local residents not to vent their anger against Tian, or towards any of the several hundred other Chinese and other foreign nationals working at Dasu.Blasphemy is a sensitive issue in Pakistan. On December 3, 2021, a Sri Lankan national working in a factory in Sialkot was lynched by a mob after workers accused him of blasphemy.The Dasu Hydropower Project site was hit by a suicide bus blast in July 2021, in which 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed.Nine Chinese nationals and two Frontier Corps soldiers were among those killed when the bus carrying Chinese engineers and workers to the site of the under-construction Dasu Dam exploded.China has been periodically expressing concern to Pakistan about the safety of hundreds of its nationals working in a host of Chinese funded projects.The Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), in a report in January 2022, stated that as many as 89 citizens were killed in 1,415 accusations and cases of blasphemy in the country since independence.The report said that from 1947 to 2021, 18 women and 71 men were extra-judicially killed over blasphemy accusations. The allegations were made against 107 women and 1,308 men.A large number of Chinese nationals have been working in Pakistan on various projects being undertaken under the CEPC.

(Representational)A Chinese worker was charged with blasphemy in northern Pakistan after angry workers surrounded his office accusing him of insulting the Prophet Mohammad, then stormed a police station to try to find him, officials said.Police moved in as crowds gathered at the Dasu hydropower project in Kohistan district on Sunday afternoon and officers took the man to a safer location, police official Naseer-ud-Din Khan said.Hundreds gathered again on Monday morning and stormed the main district police station, believing the man was hiding in the building, Mr Khan added.But officials, fearing the man might be attacked, had moved him to another district by military helicopter, Mr Khan said. The man was charged and had so far declined to give a statement, police officials said.Blasphemy is a crime under Pakistani law that can be punishable with death.No one has ever been executed for it in Pakistan, but scores of people have been lynched after being accused of the crime, including a 23-year-old man in eastern Pakistan in February and a Sri Lankan factory manager in 2021.Mr Khan said the crowd attacked the police station as officers were preparing the prosecution paperwork on Monday. The mob dispersed only after they were shown a copy of the case registered on blasphemy charges, he said.Rights groups say hundreds of people are languishing in prison accused of blasphemy as judges delay trials, fearing retribution against themselves.A suicide attack on a bus killed nine Chinese workers from the same hydropower site in 2021.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

The overall market sentiment is bearish due to the market volatility which added fuel to the fire and caused listing of the company’s shares at a discount.Avalon Tech’s debt-to-equity ratio is relatively higher compared to its peers. Also, it generates significant revenue from a limited number of customers which increases revenue concentration. Considering the current market conditions, we had advised our investors to avoid subscribing to the IPO. The company operates in a highly competitive and volatile industry but its revenue growth lagged the industry average.However, the company is well poised for growth due to long-term growth prospects in the EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) Industry. Apart from this, it can also benefit from the PLI scheme which will aid in improving its financials. The investors should look out for opportunities in this company at reasonable valuations once the company’s financials improve."

The stock listed at a mild discount of 1% on BSE at Rs 431 against an issue price of Rs 436.The shares then extended losses, falling as much as 11% in intraday trade before settling 7.78% lower at Rs 397 apiece on NSE.The Rs 865 crore-initial share sale was subscribed 2.21 times at close, lifted by strong interest from qualified institutional buyers. The QIB portion was subscribed 3.57 times, and retail investors' portion was booked 84%. Non-institutional bidders showed least interest in the issue, with just 41% subscription.The issue comprised fresh shares up to Rs 324 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to Rs 545 crore by promoters and selling shareholders.The IPO was fully priced-in at a PE ratio of around 39x.Analysts say investors with a high-risk appetite can hold on to the stock for the long term, while conservative investors may avoid sticking to the company.Fully priced-in valuations and larger portion of funds raised were going to promoters via OFS followed by lower promoter holding post the issue seems concerned to new IPO investors, said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities.In general, investors don’t like or prefer to be invested in a higher OFS IPO offer where there is no room for any upside in the near term. Hence, we advise conservative investors to avoid holding and watch out for better companies and opportunities, while risk takers can hold based on their risk appetite, Tapse said.Avalon Technologies is one of the leading fully-integrated electronic manufacturing services (EMS) companies with end-to-end operations delivering box-build solutions in India.

As per the information available on the official website of BSE — bseindia.com — the equity shares of Avalon Technologies Limited shall be listed and admitted to dealings on the Indian exchanges (BSE and NSE) in the list of 'B' group of securities.According to primary and secondary market experts, the public issue worth ₹865 crore received lackluster response from investors across categories as the issue was highly priced. They went on to add that higher valuation may foil chances of higher premium for the allottees as Avalon Technologies shares may have a flat debut on Dalal Street today. Primary market experts also believe that Avalon Technologies IPO listing price would be around ₹446 per equity share as shares of the company is available at a premium of ₹10 in grey market today.Speaking on Avalon Technologies IPO listing, Abhay Doshi, Founder at UnlistedArena.com, which deals in unlisted shares, said, The IPO of Avalon Technologies received a lackluster response across all categories. While the company has reported attractive margins compared to its peers, the IPO pricing was bit expensive, leaving little for investors on table. Additionally, primary market sentiments remains to be jittery, which may result in a flat listing for Avalon Technologies with the IPO likely to list around its issue price.Expecting further dip in Avalon Technologies share price after flat listing, A R Ramachandran, Co-founder & Trainer at Tips2trades said, Even though fundamentals of Avalon Technologies Ltd are great in terms of profitability and return ratios, PE ratio of above 50 in the current environment looks expensive. Ramachandran advised 'buy on dips' strategy post-listing in the scrip as he expected the Avalon Technologies shares to make further lows after listing.What Avalon Technologies GMP signals?According to primary market experts, Avalon Technologies IPO GMP (grey market premium) today is ₹10, which means grey market too is expecting flat listing of Avalon Technologies shares. Unlisted share market experts went on to add that Avalon Technologies IPO GMP today is ₹10, which means grey market is expecting that Avalon Technologies IPO listing price would be around ₹446 ( ₹436 + ₹10), which is around 2 per cent higher from Avalon Technologies IPO price band of ₹415 to ₹436 per equity share.Avalon Technologies management has already announced to use net proceeds from public issue for repayment of all or a portion of certain outstanding borrowings of itself and one of its subsidiaries Avalon Technology and Services. Also, the company plans to use fresh capital proceeds for funding working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.Avalon Technologies IPO subscription statusIn three days bidding from 3rd to 6th April 2023, Avalon Technologies IPO got subscribed 2.34 times on strong response by QIB category investors.

Following the transition, all US dollar denominated Nifty derivatives contracts will be exclusively traded on NSE IFSC,” the Singapore Exchange or SGX said in a notice. The SGX NSE Connect at Gift City IFSC will become fully operational from July 3 — nearly four years after it was first envisaged as a part of an exercise to stop export of domestic markets.The SGX Nifty 50 Index Futures contract is one of the most popular overseas derivatives contract traded at the SGX, with 7.3 million contracts traded so far this year. Besides Nifty50, Nifty Bank index and Nifty 50 Index Options are also traded at the SGX. Currently, trading in Nifty contracts at Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City is optional with bulk of the volumes still taking place on the Singapore bourse.With the transition, we expect more inflow of US dollars and foreign capital to India. While offering an equal playing field for both the Indian and foreign investors, the move will reduce the impact of offshore trading. This is also a major step to make GIFT city a hub for international investments, said Rohit Jain, managing partner, Singhania & Co. With these volumes now migrating to Gandhinagar, market players expect the GIFT, an initiative led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to get a huge fillip.Also Read Budget 2023: P-notes, SGX Nifty trading at GIFT City likely to get a boost Reserve Bank of India, IFSCA likely to frame fresh norms for GIFT City Several initial hiccups at GIFT City are behind us, says Injeti Srinivas City Union Bank shares crash 13.5% after Q3 earnings dip on quarterly basis ICICI Bank launches dollar bond, deposit-linked loan for NRIs at GIFT City Private equity inflow in real estate plunges 95% to $45 mn in Jan-Mar Indian equity markets to trade in range-bound manner: ICICI Securities Active clients drop for ninth month but discount brokerages build dominance Stock of this auto ancillary company has zoomed 40% in two days Nifty Realty up 13% so far in April; Godrej, DLF, Oberoi zoom up to 27%SGX has said it will perform a liquidity switch after close of business on June 30 to prepare for the transition of outstanding SGX contracts to NSE IFSC contracts. All the positions will be converted on a 1:1 ratio basis and all open positions will be migrated to NSE IFSC. “Trading of NIFTY Futures on NSE IFSC SGX Connect symbolises the futuristic role of IFSC in India. It shows the immense potential of IFSC to offer the entire gamut of financial services to global investors and organisations from Indian shores seamlessly,” said Saurabh Tiwari, Partner, DSK Legal.The arrangement between both the exchanges was proposed after the Indian bourses decided to end licensing agreements with their overseas counterparts in 2018. The decision was aimed at bringing liquidity and stop trading in domestic products on overseas exchanges. In an earlier joint update in December, NSE had said that 14 SGX clearing members had been on-boarded for the transition.The Offshore ConnectSGX NSE Connect at GIFT City IFSC was first envisaged four years agoMove will curb domestic products being traded on overseas exchanges, bring liquidity on Indian bourse All dollar-denominated Nifty derivatives contracts to be exclusively traded on NSE IFSC"

Russian oil production has proved resilient in the face of Western sanctions, defying forecasts of a steep decline.According to current forecasts, oil production will be at a stable level until 2025, Sorokin was quoted as saying by Neftegazovaya vertikal magazine.Last month, JP Morgan said Russia would be able to maintain its oil output at pre-Ukraine conflict levels due to steady demand from China and India, but it might struggle to reroute some of its oil product exports away from Europe.Russia has so far managed to reroute oil exports from Europe to India, China and Turkey, which snapped up cheap barrels despite the Group of Seven's $60 price cap on Russian crude.Speaking about plans to set up oil storage, Sorokin said there are various projects under discussion.He said such reserves would increase flexibility of supply, taking into account the current situation in international markets, high volatility in demand and oil prices.Russia does not currently have large oil storage, which would give it more flexibility in production and exports.Last year, a Russian official said that construction of storage facilities of no less than 100 million tonnes, or more than 700 million barrels, may take up to four years.

As China accelerated the buying of cheap Russian crude oil at discounts to international benchmarks, Chinese imports of crude from Russia jumped by 23.8% year over year to 1.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in January and February 2023.India, for its part, is also boosting imports of Russian oil to record levels. In February, Russia remained India's top oil supplier for a fifth consecutive month.More recently, Russian weekly crude oil exports by sea returned to above 3 million bpd in the week to April 14, bouncing back from an eight-week low in the previous week, data from vessel-tracking services compiled by Bloomberg showed earlier this week. Most of those exports are going to China and India.ADVERTISEMENTBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

                            "summary": "London CNN —Russia’s oil exports have bounced back to levels last seen before it invaded Ukraine, despite a barrage of Western sanctions.Moscow’s exports of crude oil and oil products rose in March to their highest level since April 2020, jumping by 600,000 barrels a day, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly oil report Friday. The rise lifted Russia’s estimated revenue from oil exports to $12.7 billion last month.The revenue is still down 43% from a year ago, the IEA said, as Russia is forced to sell its barrels to a more limited pool of customers who can negotiate greater discounts.Western countries have imposed a raft of sanctions on Moscow’s energy exports since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February last year. The most significant are a ban on Russian seaborne crude imports into the European Union and a ban on refined oil products such as diesel into the bloc.But Russia, the world’s second-largest exporter of crude, has found willing buyers in China and India to replace European customers.Still, sanctions have made a significant dent in Russia’s coffers. Last week, the government said declining energy revenues had contributed to a budget deficit of 2.4 trillion rubles ($29 billion) in the first three months of this year. Its overall income plunged nearly 21% compared with the same period in 2022, Reuters reported.Russia relies on the oil and gas sector to finance about 45% of its budget, according to the IEA.Supply squeezeThe IEA also said surprise cuts to crude production announced this month by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, risked “aggravating” an expected oil shortage in the second half of 2023.The IEA said OPEC+’s cuts were likely to reduce global oil supply by 400,000 barrels per day from March through December, as other producers partially compensate for the group’s action.For the year as a whole, demand is expected to climb by 2 million barrels per day to hit a record of almost 102 million barrels per day while supply will increase by only 1.2 million.The predicted oil shortfall could weigh on economies already grappling with slowing growth and historically high inflation.OPEC+ unexpectedly announced on April 2 that it would slash crude oil output by 1.66 million barrels per day. The cuts will start in May and last through the end of the year, according to an official with the Saudi energy ministry.That comes in addition to a 2 million barrel-per-day reduction the cartel announced in October.The cuts risk “boosting oil prices at a time of heightened economic uncertainty,” despite slowing industrial activity in the world’s biggest economies and increasing oil production in countries outside of OPEC+, the IEA said.Brent crude, the global benchmark, was last trading at $87 a barrel, up nearly 8.6% since OPEC+ announced the latest round of production cuts."

                            "summary": "After a lower-than-expected demand for the IPO, Avalon Technologies shares got listed at a mild discount of 1% to the issue price on Tuesday. The shares got listed at Rs 431 per share on BSE as against an offer price of Rs 436.The stock is currently trading nearly 8% down at Rs 396.90 on BSE. It hit the day's low of Rs 387.75, translating into a fall of 11% from IPO price. The tepid listing was expected after the downtrend in company shares in the unlisted market since the IPO opened for subscription. The issue was subscribed 2.21 times at close.Analysts say investors with high-risk appetite can hold on to the stock for the long term, while conservative investors may avoid sticking to the company.Most brokerages had a subscribe recommendation to the IPO only for the long term as it offers an opportunity to investors to get exposed to the electronics sector.The IPO, which comprised fresh issue of shares up to Rs 324 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to Rs 545 crore, was fully priced-in at a PE ratio of around 39x.Fully priced-in valuations and larger portion of funds raised going to promoters via OFS followed by lower promoter holding post the issue seems concerning to new IPO investors, said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities.In general investors don’t like or prefer to be invested in a higher OFS IPO offer where there is no room for any upside in the near term. Hence, we advise conservative investors to avoid holding and watch out for better companies and opportunities, while risk takers can hold based on their risk appetite, Tapse said.Avalon Technologies is one of the leading fully-integrated electronic manufacturing services (EMS) companies with end-to-end operations in delivering box-build solutions in India. The company provides a full-stack product and solution suite, from printed circuit board design and assembly to the manufacturing of complete electronic systems.Pravesh Gour of Swastika Investmart says the company saw a decline in its PAT margin during the first eight months of FY22 and currently has a high debt ratio.Investors with a high-risk tolerance may consider holding Avalon Technologies shares for long-term, with a recommended stop loss of around 405, which is the lower price band of the issue, said Pravesh Gour.The company plans to use proceeds from the fresh issue for the repayment of the borrowings and funding the working capital requirements."

The overall market sentiment is bearish due to the market volatility which added fuel to the fire and caused listing of the company’s shares at a discount.Avalon Tech’s debt-to-equity ratio is relatively higher compared to its peers. Also, it generates significant revenue from a limited number of customers which increases revenue concentration. Considering the current market conditions, we had advised our investors to avoid subscribing to the IPO. The company operates in a highly competitive and volatile industry but its revenue growth lagged the industry average.However, the company is well poised for growth due to long-term growth prospects in the EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) Industry. Apart from this, it can also benefit from the PLI scheme which will aid in improving its financials. The investors should look out for opportunities in this company at reasonable valuations once the company’s financials improve."

                            "summary": "Avalon Technologies IPO listing date has been fixed on 18th April 2023 i.e. today. As per the information available on the official website of BSE — bseindia.com — the equity shares of Avalon Technologies Limited shall be listed and admitted to dealings on the Indian exchanges (BSE and NSE) in the list of 'B' group of securities.According to primary and secondary market experts, the public issue worth ₹865 crore received lackluster response from investors across categories as the issue was highly priced. They went on to add that higher valuation may foil chances of higher premium for the allottees as Avalon Technologies shares may have a flat debut on Dalal Street today. Primary market experts also believe that Avalon Technologies IPO listing price would be around ₹446 per equity share as shares of the company is available at a premium of ₹10 in grey market today.Speaking on Avalon Technologies IPO listing, Abhay Doshi, Founder at UnlistedArena.com, which deals in unlisted shares, said, The IPO of Avalon Technologies received a lackluster response across all categories. While the company has reported attractive margins compared to its peers, the IPO pricing was bit expensive, leaving little for investors on table. Additionally, primary market sentiments remains to be jittery, which may result in a flat listing for Avalon Technologies with the IPO likely to list around its issue price.Expecting further dip in Avalon Technologies share price after flat listing, A R Ramachandran, Co-founder & Trainer at Tips2trades said, Even though fundamentals of Avalon Technologies Ltd are great in terms of profitability and return ratios, PE ratio of above 50 in the current environment looks expensive. Ramachandran advised 'buy on dips' strategy post-listing in the scrip as he expected the Avalon Technologies shares to make further lows after listing.What Avalon Technologies GMP signals?According to primary market experts, Avalon Technologies IPO GMP (grey market premium) today is ₹10, which means grey market too is expecting flat listing of Avalon Technologies shares. Unlisted share market experts went on to add that Avalon Technologies IPO GMP today is ₹10, which means grey market is expecting that Avalon Technologies IPO listing price would be around ₹446 ( ₹436 + ₹10), which is around 2 per cent higher from Avalon Technologies IPO price band of ₹415 to ₹436 per equity share.Avalon Technologies management has already announced to use net proceeds from public issue for repayment of all or a portion of certain outstanding borrowings of itself and one of its subsidiaries Avalon Technology and Services. Also, the company plans to use fresh capital proceeds for funding working capital requirements and general corporate purposes.Avalon Technologies IPO subscription statusIn three days bidding from 3rd to 6th April 2023, Avalon Technologies IPO got subscribed 2.34 times on strong response by QIB category investors.

                            "summary": "Bournvita has become a household name over the years. Since its development in the 1920s, the chocolate malt drink is being marketed as a health drink. Manufactured by Cadbury, a subsidiary of Mondelez International, it is sold in the United Kingdom and North America, as well as India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Benin, and Togo.Recently, a social media influencer, Revant Himatsingka, who goes by the username Food Pharmer has triggered a row after he revealed some “hidden facts” about the ingredients list marketed by Cadbury.What is the controversy around Bournvita?In a now-deleted video, Revant explained that Bournvita uses ingredients that, if consumed on a daily basis, could lead to diabetes. The social media influencer also claimed that one of the ingredients, which is a colouring agent, used in the making of the product causes cancer.“The tagline of Bournvita is ‘taiyari jeet ki’ but rather, it should be ‘taiyari diabetes ki’,” he said in the video. Soon after the video went viral, Revant shared a post on his Instagram detailing how he has issued an apology to the company and never meant to malign them. In the post, he mentioned that he received a legal notice.“I have decided to take down the (Bournvita) video after receiving a legal notice from one of India’s biggest law firms on 13 April. I apologise to Cadbury for making the video. I did not plan or intend to infringe any trademark or defame any company nor do I have the interest or resources to participate in any court cases and I request MNCs to not take this forward legally.” Revant wrote.Also Read Cadbury Dairy Milk rolls out #CheerForAllSports campaign amid the IPL feverReportedly, the video had received 12 million views on Instagram by the time it was taken down under pressure.Following this, the Mondelez India-owned health drink brand released a statement rejecting such claims.The company stated the claims made by the influencer, who took down the video after being served a legal notice, are “unscientific” as he “distorted facts and made false and negative inferences”. Himatsingka claims to be a nutritionist and a health coach.The video was widely shared by netizens including actor-politician Paresh Rawal and former cricketer and MP Kirti Azad. The whole episode has triggered a dabate on whether Bournvita should be marketed as a health drink.What Bournvita’s take on the matter?In a statement shared over e-mail, a spokesperson of Bournvita told Financial Express.com that over the last seven decades, “Bournvita has earned the trust of consumers in India by being a scientifically formulated product that adheres to the highest quality standards and complies with all the laws of the land.”“That is why we were concerned by a recent unscientific video on social media that went abnormally viral, distorted facts and made false and negative inferences about Bournvita’s safety and efficacy. The Presenter’s comments are not based on science and were designed to drive anxiety and fear among our loyal consumers by misrepresenting the facts and omitting factually correct information to sensationalize his view,” the spokesperson said.The company also claimed that the video has created panic and anxiety and “questions the trust that consumers have bestowed on brands like Bournvita.”“As we continued to witness an abnormal and unusual amount of traction on the post, we were constrained to take legal recourse to avoid misinformation. We also issued a statement to clarify and share the correct facts to allay the concerns of our consumers. We would like to clarify that we had no play in actions around the presenter’s Twitter account,” the spokesperson told Financial Express.com.All our claims are verified and transparent and all ingredients have regulatory approvals. All the necessary nutritional information is mentioned on the pack for consumers to make informed choices, the spokesperson said.The company also claimed that Bournvita is best consumed with a glass of 200 ml hot or cold milk as highlighted on the pack. Every serve of 20 gm of Bournvita has 7.5 grams of added sugar, which is approximately one and a half teaspoons. This is much less than the daily recommended intake limits of sugar for children, the spokesperson added.Bournvita contains nutrients namely Vitamin A, C, D, B12, Iron, Zinc, Copper and Selenium which supports the immune system. These have been part of our formulation and we have always called out “Helps with healthy functioning of the immune system” on the back of our pack for several years (even before the Covid-19 pandemic), the spokesperson said.“Caramel Colour (150 C) is within permissible limits as per guidelines defined by regulations. All ingredients are safe, approved for use and within permissible limits as per the regulatory guidelines,” the spokesperson said.‘Misleading the consumers with fake claims’After Revant’s video and his claims came under the spotlight, Consumer Voice, a Voluntary Action Group of Academicians, Professionals and Volunteers who work relentlessly to raise awareness amongst Indian consumers, wrote to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and Consumer Affairs Department.“The entire episode of misleading the consumers with fake claims by popular brands has been reported many times to concerned offices. Brands loaded with high salt, sugar and saturated fats making tall claims shamelessly as healthy foods or supplements for specially children and elderly under the shadow of the declaration at the back of the pack can only be addressed if Front of Pack Warning labels is put informing consumers about the health harms. Only consumer awareness can address the issue with a strong FOPL Regulation,” Ashim Sanyal, COO, Consumer Voice, told Financial Express.com.Also Read Cadbury Gems unveils artwork-based NFTs for charitable purposesWhat is the recommended level of sugar for children?According to Dr Amish Vora, Pediatrician and Neonatal Intensivist at Bhatia Hospital Mumbai, children between the age of 2 to 18 years should have less than 6 teaspoons of sugar or 24 gms of sugar. Meanwhile, Children less than 2 years should not have any added sugar.“This is because a lot of children now are obese, have type 2 diabetes. Young adults are having heart disease and heart problems with a lot of chronic and allergic conditions coming to children when they grow up. It is important to restrict them from eating a lot of processed food, carbonated and sugary drinks unless it is being medically prescribed by the doctor. It is best to avoid over the counter products since they contain high sugar content,” Dr. Vora told Financial Express.com.Dr. Vora also revealed that most of the carbonated drinks have 10 gms of sugar per 100 ml, and since the consumption would be more than 100 ml, the sugar content increases. Some of the carbonated drinks go up to 15 gms of sugar as well, he revealed.“Health drinks in India claim to provide nutrition and energy, but they tend to give us energy in the form of empty calories primarily from simple starches and sugar which are not a healthy choice, especially for children and adults who have an obesity problem. Simple starches and sugars are known to cause obesity and obesity, as we know, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and hypertension,” Dr Paparao Nadakuduru, Sr. Consultant Physician & HOD – Internal Medicine, Citizens Specialty Hospital, Hyderabad​​ told Financial Expres.com.Dr. Nadakuduru maintained that such drinks must be avoided by people who have lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes etc.“Again, these may also contain gluten and lactose from milk solids, which should be avoided by people with gluten or lactose intolerance. Basically, it’s the high sugar content in such drinks that makes it detrimental to the health of children and youth,” Dr. Nadakuduru revealed.According to Dr. Edwina Raj, Head – of Clinical Nutrition Dietetics, Aster CMI Hospital, four teaspoons of health drink supplement contains between 1g to 6.5g of sugar(1.2tsp) in most of the leading brands which are available over the counter.“As claimed this is no doubt within the recommended amount of calories (<10%) from sugar as per WHO guidelines for a healthy child to ensure that they do not indulge in high intake of simple sugars that increases the risk of obesity and chronic diseases. But the incidences of childhood obesity is in the rise and sugar intake is one of the reasons for weight gain. A child will not stop at this health drink but continue to indulge in sugar beverages , jams, spreads , candies, jellies , cakes, biscuits , ketchups ,etc which are also the sources of sugar,” Dr. Raj told Financial Express.com.Dr. Raj emphasises that one cannot eliminate this completely in a child’s diet as they are completely exposed to it , hence portion size is the key rather than eliminating it completely which later increases their craving towards it.“As nutritionists we should help parents explore other options rather than focusing only on foods to eliminate since parents are already frustrated with child’s unhealthy eating habits,” she added.Are Health Supplements Needed?Dr. Raj pointed out that only your nutritionist will be able to assess your child’s current nutrient intake and will prescribe supplements if necessary based on the deficit of nutrients in daily food intake which will ensure nutritional adequacy and prevents deficiencies or toxicities of such supplements.“Every Health drink or supplement varies in composition and consists of both benefits and downside of additives in them. They are also loaded with carbohydrate between 12-17g in 4tsp of supplement which when added to milk is equivalent to one serving of cereal  chapathi consumed for breakfast. Therefore this needs to be considered while planning a child’s daily meal to ensure we do not go overboard in feeding them which will increase the risk of being overweight and prone to lifestyle diseases,” she added.She also warned that we are surrounded by multiple products with nutrition labels and lengthy claims but it is equally important for every consumer to understand that no claims should be blindly accepted.“…rather, it is imperative to seek healthcare professionals, understand one s health condition and get a nutrition prescription accordingly from a Registered Dietitian,” Dr. Raj added.According to Dr Shreya Dubey – Consultant – Neonatology & Paediatrics, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, if parents are looking for health supplements for their children, they should make sure, that the supplements don’t consist of much sugar. The sugar intake of the child must be balanced and should be within amount of the overall daily diet.“It is partially true that health drinks which are supplements taken alongside with milk or water, contain calories, proteins, minerals, micro-nutrients, and vitamins, are only given to children who are under weight or children who are very fussy,” Dr. Dubey told Financial Express.com.Dr. Dubey also maintained that if the child is fine and can properly grow then the supplements are not necessary.“Health supplements do have all the nutrients but also come packed with a lot of hidden sugar which if taken by children in a lot of amount can cause obesity, cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes. Therefore, children who are recommended to take these supplements by a paediatrician are only advised to take. There is no study that states that these supplements cause cancer, but if the child has a high sugar consumption and is even taking these health drinks, then due to sugar-surplus, there can be a chance of cancer in later years,” Dr. Dubey added."

Are powdered products that we give to kids really healthy drinks? Do they provide the necessary nutrients for child growth and development? Or is it just sugar neatly packed as tasty health supplements?For decades, several brands have sold these powdered drinks for children that are claimed to enhance healthy muscle growth and have body development properties. These powders are suggested to be mixed in a glass of milk and given to children to help them consume vitamins and nutrients necessary for the growth of the body.advertisementInstagram influencer Revant Himatsingka, who goes by the name Food Pharmer, released a viral video slamming Bournvita, a company owned by Cadbury, explaining its ingredients list. The viral video has raised questions about the authenticity of various health drinks sold in India for children.IndiaToday.in spoke to health experts to better understand what's inside these chocolatey drinks.SUGAR, SUGAR AND A LOT OF SUGARWhile most products claim that they contain nutrients and vitamins essential for a child's overall body development, experts have stated that many of them do contain excessive amounts of sugar that should not be given to a child.ALSO READ | Influencer who went viral for criticising Cadbury’s Bournvita takes down video. Here’s whyIn fact, there are many factors that come to play here. Dr Edwina Raj, Head of Clinical Nutrition Dietetics, Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore told IndiaToday.in that those products produced by various brands and marketed as healthy for children differ in composition.They are mainly considered supplements that have both benefits and side effects. Just like medicine, one should know how much of these products should really be included in your diet. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images)Just like medicine, one should know how much of these products should really be included in your diet and if they are included, then what should be the quantity and for what age, Dr Edwina Raj said.Dr Saurabh Khanna, Lead Consultant, Neonatology and Pediatrics, CK Birla Hospital in Gurgaon told IndiaToday.in that most manufacturers portray these products to be energy and vitamin-rich drinks but what they don't show is that these products have high amounts of sugar.Ideally, these products should not be offered to kids because they belong to the ultra-processed food category and it should best be avoided, said Dr Khanna. He further added that these can lead to excessive weight gain, dental caries (damaged and tiny holes in the teeth), and chronic lifestyle-related ailments.These products are mostly portrayed to have a good amount of malt and barley derivatives, but they'll always contain ingredients that should not be offered to the general public, especially high amounts of sugar, said Dr Khanna.advertisementWHEN SHOULD YOU GIVE THESE SUPPLEMENTS TO CHILDREN?Experts say that only for kids who are undernourished and when parents are not able to provide enough nutrition to the child, that is when these supplements can be given to kids for a short duration of time in their formative years.ALSO READ | How to deal with the development of kids diagnosed with autismWe have made the blunder of introducing these drinks to children. We have to consider the ingredients mentioned in these products, Dr Edwina Raj added. Some of them do contain inexpensive ingredients like soy, peanuts, and even maltodextrin, while others are superior in composition.Maltodextrin, in particular, mentioned in most products, is not recommended in a few conditions. But at the same time, it is prescribed for some other disorders in children. So, we treat every individual with different nutrition prescriptions but general advice can do more harm, said Dr Raj.Dr Sameer Punia, Consultant and Lead Pediatric Intensivist, Department of Pediatric, Aakash Healthcare, Noida told IndiaToday.in that the concept of health drinks that a lot of brands are coming up with claim to be immunity boosters, especially after the pandemic. Since most drinks have nutrients and vitamins extracted from fruits and vegetables, consuming natural sources is much better, says expert. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images)advertisementPractically, immunity is boosted by immunisation and that cannot be done by energy drinks. When you look at the ingredients, you will find that in many of these products, the maximum content will be sugar among the first three ingredients. Sugars are the energy source of the body but invariably, when you consume sugar, it will give you energy because it is a carbohydrate, said Dr Sameer Punia.WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?Since most drinks have nutrients and vitamins extracted from fruits and vegetables, consuming natural sources is much better.The bottom line that experts suggest is that parents shouldn't give into marketing gimmicks about brands claiming more vitamins and nutrients in their products. Supplements should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional and for a short amount of time, said Dr Edwina Raj.ALSO READ | What is R21?

In that case, we offer health supplements and not more than once a day, so it doesn't become a habit for the child, said Dr Saurabh Khanna.Dr. Sameer Punia said that when you reduce junk food in the house, kids will automatically move towards natural foods."

                            "summary": ", Executive Director,, says that “ITC’s cigarettes and FMCG, which are the bulk of the business, are going to see a great FY24. The legal cigarette industry is gaining market share from the illegal, which is still around 23% of the market because of the rational tax policy. Also, we expect that in FMCG, just like other companies, ITC 's gross and EBITDA margins will start expanding, improving from Q4 and FY24 should be a good year from a margin recovery perspective.”Yes, we have a strong buy on ITC. It is at a 52-week-high and last year also, in the Nifty, ITC was among the best performing stocks and we expect that to recur this year also. In fact , at our model consumer portfolio, we have a 30% weightage on ITC, which is the highest along with Godrej Consumer. We also like Britannia and HUL. In ITC, even in Q4, we expect double digit volume growth in cigarettes. If you see a four-year CAGR in Q4 and Q3, it will be fairly similar. So they have continued to do quite well.The legal cigarette industry is gaining market share from the illegal, which is still around 23% of the market but illegal is losing market share because of the rational tax policy. Also, we expect that in FMCG, just like other companies, ITC's gross and EBITDA margins will start expanding, improving from Q4 and FY24 should be a good year from a margin recovery perspective.A slight issue will be in the agri-business because last year in Q4, agri-business had a very high base. So there will be some dip, but that is a commodity kind of a business. The key businesses for ITC are obviously cigarettes and FMCG. The market is liking that. For three, four years, the government has shown a very rational tax policy. Now we will also see how the value unlock happens in the hotel business because that is something which will show that the focus of the company is more on the cigarette, FMCG – stronger return ratio businesses.Yes, it is definitely a buy. You are right that when you compare ITC's valuation with the consumer staples, you will see that ITC is still quite attractive but you also need to see how cigarette stocks globally are valued because for ITC, 80% of the profit is still coming from cigarettes and that is something we need to take into consideration.Given the global uncertainties and the way the tech sector is getting impacted, we also saw that even domestically, the start-ups and a lot of the other discretionary businesses are getting demand slow down. In that scenario, ITC with high predictability of earnings and very good dividend yield and value unlock they are talking about in the hotel business, has clear triggers. FMCG should do well as a sector and ITC should be among the best performing stocks in that pack.ITC is one of the key hotel players in the country but in the overall target price, cigarette and FMCG are the bulk. The hotel business does not really contribute too much from a target price perspective but the intent of the company is very clear.In the last few years, they have said that they will focus on the management contracts rather than doing too much of investments on their own. Of course, some marquee properties in key cities will continue but the whole idea is to have a more focus on management contracts that will improve the return ratio because hotel business intrinsically is a low return ratio business.What the management has highlighted also is the value-unlock here in the hotel and that is something investors will like because ITC is a very diversified business. It is more of intent on value unlock rather than the hotel’s high growth numbers. I do not think it impacts too much from a target price perspective for ITC.On the key businesses which you highlighted – cigarette and FMCG – we are quite positive in terms of outlook in FY24. We expect double digit earnings for both these businesses and expect good margin recovery for the FMCG business which should drive a strong double digit earnings growth in the FMCG part of the business.Even in cigarettes, we expect double digit earnings growth driven by a healthy volume growth and a price hike of around 2%. On the rest of the business, paper, again, ITC is quite well placed in the mid and premium and there also we are seeing slight deflation happening because the raw material side has corrected. The sales growth number and slightly on the Q4 margins also, there will be some pressure but that is because there is a correction in the commodity cost for paper companies.Agri is based on the macro, based on how wheat production is, how the inflation is and that will be linked to how government policies are. Currently, wheat export is banned. ITC is doing a great job in terms of tobacco and other commodity exports but wheat exports last year had done really well, but currently there is a ban on that. That is something we need to watch out for.Overall, the tech industry is facing some headwinds, as we have seen in Infosys and TCS results. That again, is not something which is really going to be a big trigger. My view is that cigarettes and FMCG, which are the bulk of the business, are going to see a great FY24."

In comparison, benchmark Nifty has delivered a flattish return negative 0.68%. The stock has almost doubled in the last two years.The stock has moved in the range of Rs 318 to Rs 356 levels from September 2022 to January with volumes being quite low during this period. The price breached the consolidation phase at 356 and moved upwards with high volumes to make an all-time high of 394 odd levels.Investors can buy the stock from the current levels and more on dips of Rs 382 for a target price of Rs 450-490 in the next six to eight months, according to Chheda. The stop loss can be kept at Rs 365 on a weekly closing basis, said Viral Chheda, Technical Analyst, SAJ Finance & Securities.The sustained rally in ITC can be attributed to its resilient performance in the past few quarters, despite an uncertain demand environment and sustained inflationary pressures on margins. Despite the rally, the stock is sitting with attractive valuations at 23x21x its FY2024FY2025E EPS.Brokerage JM Financial , meanwhile, has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 440.We continue to expect that the government’s increasingly logical stance on tobacco taxation remains a key value-driver for the ITC stock, and there is increasing evidence of the policy environment in recent years being quite supportive, it said.Sharekhan too has a Buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 450, which shows an upside potential of 12.5% from the current levels.In the recent December quarter, ITC posted a net profit of Rs 5,031 crore, up 21% year-on-year, while revenue from operations, net of excise duty, rose 2% YoY to Rs 16,226 crore.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

                            "summary": "TCSAn outgoing chief executive officer (CEO). A successor waiting in the wings. A crushing banking crisis -- the January-March quarter has been full of unexpected turns for the country’s biggest information technology (IT) services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).TCS kick starts the fourth quarter IT earnings season on April 12. A source in the know said CEO-designate K Krithivasan too will be present at the presser even as current CEO and managing director (MD) Rajesh Gopinathan announces the Q4 performance.The stage is set for Krithivasan to take over as TCS CEO, nearly six years after he was considered for the position alongside Gopinathan.This TCS earnings call will be unlike any other in recent times, as discussions are expected to take an interesting turn amid anticipation for updates on organisational and business restructuring, a new BFSI head, navigating a global macro environment, hiring plans, and more.Here are five key aspects to watch out for at the TCS earnings call:Commentary on business strategy changesKrithivasan, who was appointed as a the new CEO and MD-designate on March 16, has maintained that there won’t be any great organisational or strategic changes as he takes over and Gopinathan continues with the company still September. The company is also in talks with Gopinathan for further engagement in an advisory role.However, sources told Moneycontrol that TCS’ organisational overhaul into four distinctive business groups unveiled in April 2022, categorising clients based on their journeys with TCS caused unrest for several senior leaders in the firm. Krithivasan who was then heading the global BFSI vertical reportedly kept his vertical out of these restructured units.Gopinathan’s current tenure as CEO and MD was to end in 2027. So, his sudden resignation came as a shock. He said that the monotony of earnings for the past 40 quarters and doing the same thing every 13 weeks got the better of him and he wanted to move on to doing something new.Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang, said in his note, “While the new CEO, K Krithivasan, has not indicated any radical change in strategy, we would wait to see if there are any minor tweaks to it (especially around the new corporate structure of addressing different sets of clients which was instituted a year back and was indicated to be ex-CEO, Rajesh Gopinathan’s idea).”Impact of the banking crisisNot just TCS, but rivals too will be tracked closely for any commentary on how the BFSI sector crisis will impact demand outlook and overall global client sentiments. This quarter was marked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and the likely impact on the sectors and industries dependent on it.As of the quarter-ended December, BFSI accounted for over 38 percent of TCS’ revenue.Pai said, “The commentary around BFSI will be keenly watched, as TCS has likely got the highest exposure in the Tier-1 set with large relationships developed over the decades in both, the US as well as Europe.”According to analysts, while the collapse of these regional US-based banks won't have a direct impact on the Indian IT services firms, but there are some delays expected in decision making in the near term, for the next six months.Revenue growthAccording to a poll by CNBC TV18, overall growth for Q4 is expected to be less than in Q3 as uncertainty continues to prevail amidst a tough business environment. Quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth estimates have varied from 0.1 percent to 1.7 percent.Analysts estimate a muted revenue growth on QoQ basis, but TCS is likely to lead Tier-I IT companies in terms of growth reported.“We expect muted revenue growth for TCS over the next two quarters at 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent QoQ in CC (constant currency) terms due to delay in decision-making in its two most important geographies, North America and Continental Europe, which together account for roughly 70 percent of its overall revenues,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.Analysts added, “We expect revival of demand starting September 2023 with postponed projects getting executed, along with cost optimisation deals.”Meanwhile, analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities forecast a much higher QoQ revenue growth at 1.1 percent and 11.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) in CC terms. “Growth will likely be led by spending on cloud and digital programs, cost take-outs and wallet sharevendor consolidation gains. Exposure to impacted banking clients will not materially impact revenue growth in our view in the quarter,” the note said.So far, the highest QoQ revenue growth estimate for Q4 has been from Nomura at 1.7 percent.EBIT margins are likely to improve by 40-50 basis points (bps) QoQ from Q3’s 24.5 percent, according to estimates by analysts. Commentary on how the company reaches the pre-COVID margin range of 26-28 percent will be tracked.Hiring updatesFor the first time in the past 10 quarters, TCS reported a slowdown in net new quarterly employee addition at negative 2,197 in Q3FY23. Will there be further slowdown in employee addition, what will be the hiring targets and outlook as we move into FY24 – these will be key questions.At TCS, attrition rates since the beginning of FY23, have continued to improve. TCS’ Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Milind Lakkad, in the previous quarter said the drop in headcount addition was a “planned” move to improve utilisation rates. TCS, like its peers, had hired in large numbers in 2022.Analysts forecast that in this quarter too, the hiring numbers will be controlled as it looks to improve margins and utilisation rates.Commentary on large deal-winsIrrespective of the global macro challenges, TCS continued to report large multi-year deal-wins last quarter. In February, TCS announced the extension partnership with United Kingdom-based client Phoenix Group in a $723-million deal. According to media reports, TCS is also set to close multiple deals worth $1 billion with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S).While previously TCS had said that it will maintain a QoQ total contract value (TCV) of $7-9 billion, analysts estimate that the company might cross this band in Q4.“We expect strong deal-wins of $10 bn+ for the quarter, assuming normal renewal component. We do not include TCV from (the) mega deal with BSNL that is likely to be signed with TCS. TCS' commentary on growth outlook will be keenly followed. TCS is expected to be a beneficiary of higher focus of enterprises on cost take-outs and core modernisation,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in their note.Will this deal-win momentum continue, what’s the demand outlook for FY24 – these would be worth noting.(Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

                            "summary": "Domestic stock markets snapped the nine-day winning streak on Monday, thanks to a selloff in IT stocks following a soft set of quarterly numbers from software exporter Infosys. Sensex declined 520.25 points, 0.68 per cent, to 59,910.75. Nifty dropped 121 points, or 0.68 per cent, to 17,706.86.Weak Q4 results by Infosys dragged the IT pack with stocks such as Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies taking a hit ahead of quarterly results. Here is what Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher has to say on these stocks ahead of Tuesday's trading session:Tech Mahindra | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,110-1,125 | Stop Loss: Rs 990Shares of Tech Mahindra have been moving within a tight range for quite some time since July 2022 resisting near Rs 1,160 levels. They are maintaining support of Rs 990 level. After a weak opening on Monday, the stock came near the base of the range. One can pick the stock, keeping the stop loss of Rs 990, and expect for some further upward move till Rs 1,110-1,115 levels.Wipro | Cautious | Resistance: Rs 398-400 | Support: Rs 380Wipro has slipped further to touch the low of Rs 352 level, which is the support base of the descending channel pattern on the daily chart from where the scrip witnessed a pullback. One can expect for some further upward move with a resistance near the 50 EMA level of Rs 380. A breach of the same can push the stock towards the next target of 200-DMA level at Rs 398-400 zone.HCL Technologies | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,110-1,120 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,000HCL Technologies has fallen below the 200DMA level of Rs 1,030 and has come near the crucial support zone of Rs 1,010 level from where one can anticipate some pullback and improvement in bias.

I wanted to provide a better life for my children, which is why we came to Sudan,” said Prabhu S, from Karnataka’s Hakki Pikki tribe, who is among several Indian nationals stuck in violence-hit Sudan.Fierce fighting has erupted since Saturday between the military and the country’s paramilitary force in Khartoum, where at least 31 tribals from Karnataka are stuck.Prabhu (36), from Davangere district, and his wife Soniya (27) left India 10 months ago, while their four children – two boys aged 5 and 8 and two girls aged 10 and 14 – stayed back.Speaking to The Indian Express over the phone, he said: “From my father, we inherited 4.5 acres, but it was taken away from the government, which said it was forest land. My ancestors hunted and caught birds; we did not get any education. We thought of coming to Sudan so we can grow financially.”The couple sell ayurvedic products, for which they say demand in Sudan, and Africa in general, is high.Anil Kumar, another tribal man who runs a similar business, said, “Our tribe has continued to be neglected, and we have no choice but to go to African countries for a living.”Prabhu said: “With no job in India, my loans crossed Rs 10 lakh. That was when we decided to work in African countries for five years. We took a Rs 3 lakh loan to buy air tickets and to transport materials to Sudan.”AdvertisementAlso Read | Indians in Sudan’s Khartoum asked to stay indoors amid clashes between paramilitary and army“In a day, we could earn Rs 2,000- Rs 3,000. Despite the high cost of living, there is demand for Indian ayurvedic medicines here.

My deepest condolences to their families and pray for the peace in the region,” the Congress leader, who is leading the election campaign ahead of the Assembly elections in Karnataka, said.Responding sharply, Jaishankar said, “Simply appalled at your tweet!

We sincerely request all fellow Indians to continue to stay where they are and not venture outside,” the mission had said in its second advisory after violence broke out in Khartoum."

                            "summary": "As the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition in Maharashtra faces fresh possible trouble from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) end, the man at the heart of it is again Ajit Pawar – the nephew in the shadow of the big uncle.On Tuesday, Ajit denied talk of him leaving the NCP, splitting the NCP, or parting ways with the MVA as “rumours”. However, given Sharad Pawar’s deft realpolitik and nephew Ajit’s own reputation of vacillation – with or without Pawar Senior’s blessings – few believe this story is over.Also in Political Pulse | Ajit Pawar cancels Pune rally, rumours of his plans surface againThrough his various brushes with controversy, what has kept Ajit going is the support he enjoys among NCP MLAs. In November 2010, for example, when the alleged Adarsh scam hit the Maharashtra government and the Congress-NCP decided to change the names at the top, the NCP sidelined senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal as Deputy CM to bring in Ajit after an overwhelming majority of NCP MLAs supported him – marking the first of his four tenures as Maharashtra Deputy CM.The son of Sharad Pawar’s elder brother Anantrao, Ajit first rose in politics like the rest of the family through the cooperative sector. He was a constant by his uncle’s side starting 1991-92, and rose in prominence after Pawar broke away from the Congress to form the NCP.In 1999, Ajit became a Cabinet minister in a Congress-NCP government. He subsequently went on to helm heavyweight ministries including Irrigation, Rural Development, Water Resources and Finance, which raised his clout, particularly in his pocket borough of Western Maharashtra.Ajit came to be known for his slightly brusque but “efficient” way of functioning, and for “getting things done”. He was also instrumental in creating a new rung of NCP leaders, whose allegiance lies strongly with him.In 2004, Ajit publicly differed with the party leadership’s decision to concede chief ministership to the Congress despite emerging as the single largest party. Later, he was appointed Deputy CM in the alliance.AdvertisementBut, it was the entry of Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule’s entry into politics in the 2009 parliamentary elections that first led to speculation about unease within the NCP first family.Also Read | Amid speculations of Ajit Pawar joining BJP, all eyes on ED case hearing tomorrow in MSCB caseIn 2012, Ajit suddenly resigned as Deputy CM over accusations of irregularities in irrigation projects during his tenure as Water Resources Minister, putting the Congress government into a crisis as other NCP ministers threatened to follow suit. Then too, Sharad Pawar stepped in to save the government.The next talk of dissent from the Ajit camp coincided with the entry into politics of Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar, just before the 2019 Assembly elections. In contrast, Ajit had to fight tooth and nail to get his son, Parth, a Lok Sabha ticket from Maval. Such was the bad blood that this was cited as one of the reasons for Sharad Pawar not contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.AdvertisementEventually, while Rohit won the Assembly elections from Karjat Jamkhed, Parth lost in Maval. Ajit himself retained Baramati – a constituency he has been winning since 1991 – by 1.65 lakh votes, the largest victory margin in the state.This boost is what is believed to have given Ajit the confidence to pull off his biggest “rebellion” yet, when he overnight joined hands with the BJP and Devendra Fadnavis after the 2019 Assembly elections, which did not give anyone a clear majority, on the promise of an NCP-BJP government. That lasted only three days, and the NCP surprisingly allowed Ajit to walk right back into the party after it.The verdict remains out on what exactly transpired then – with Fadnavis recently claiming that Sharad Pawar had carefully planned that “rebellion”, contrary to his public posturing at the time. The consensus though remains that despite Ajit’s hold over them, the NCP MLAs had chosen to play safe and stay with Sharad Pawar.But, apart from loss of face, Ajit didn’t lose much from the episode. In the MVA government that followed, Ajit was again the Deputy CM. And when the MVA government fell in 2021 after the split in the Shiv Sena, Ajit remained right at top as the Leader of the Opposition. He was never publicly called upon to offer an explanation for the midnight episode.Also Read | NCP MLAs ready to back Ajit Pawar but want to avoid repeat of Sena crisis, 2019 reduxWhat has held constant through Ajit’s peregrinations is that he has never uttered a word against his uncle, and that Sharad Pawar too has ensured a careful division of labour. Pawar Senior rarely comments or interferes in state-related political and organisational matters, leaving those to Ajit, except in the case of big events. Ajit, in turn, does not speak on national issues. Sule, who represents the Baramati Lok Sabha constituency, limits herself to her seat when it comes to handling political issues.AdvertisementAjit finds himself in the latest drama now after constant rumours over the past year of being soft on his short-lived partner Fadnavis. Detractors ask why Ajit’s political attacks on the Sena-BJP government are limited to the Shinde faction.Many NCP leaders contend that Ajit is watching out for himself, given the allegations against him. He has been dogged by charges regarding irrigation projects since his time as deputy CM in 2012, and also faces allegations regarding cooperative banks and sugar factories. In recent MVA talks, Sharad Pawar is believed to have suggested that he could understand the pressure his MLAs were under, given the cases against them.AdvertisementAjit at least has got a breather. Days ago, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Scam. The names of both Ajit and his wife were missing from it."

They were seen together at their party's annual Iftar party at Mumbai's Islam Gymkhana.Supriya Sule, Dilip Walse-Patil, and Jitendra Awhad were among several NCP leaders who attended the event.The buzz about Ajit Pawar started last week when he suddenly cancelled his scheduled meetings and also made comments which were seen as being soft on the BJP and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's camp. The BJP is part of Maharashtra's Shinde government.Earlier in the day, Ajit Pawar, however, refuted the talk of a rift with the NCP, accusing the media of spreading rumours without any reason. There is no truth to any rumour. I am with the NCP and I will stay with the NCP, he said.Sharad Pawar also dismissed the speculations and said Ajit Pawar was busy with the party's work and that there was no need for the media to drag the issue.Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar, at the party, indirectly attacked the Uttar Pradesh government over the killing of gangster Atiq Ahmed.A country runs as per the Constitution and law. If ruling forces inculcate the habit of taking steps by ignoring the Constitution and law, we will go down the wrong path, he said without naming anyone.If taking steps by forgetting law and Constitution and by taking the law into hands is spoken of and if attempts are made to create such an atmosphere, it is not right for the nation, Mr Pawar added.Atiq Ahmed was shot dead on live television along with his brother while police were escorting them for a medical check-up on Saturday. The murder has drawn sharp reactions from the opposition leaders over the law and order situation in the state."

                            "summary": "A day after he joined the Congress, former Karnataka Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar on Tuesday minced no words as he hit out at BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh, alleging that those loyal to him were promoted at the expense of many senior leaders.Shettar said the BJP would face defeat even though Santhosh was able to execute his “game plan”. “There is a saying in the party (BJP), that the party is more important than any individual. However, (these days) loyalty to a person is more important than loyalty to the party. Those loyal to him were given priority,” said the former CM, who was a six-time BJP MLA.The ruling party has fielded Mahesh Tenginakayi from Hubli-Dharwad Central, whom Shettar called Santhosh’s “Manasa Putra (blue-eyed boy)”. Said the former CM, “Because of Santhosh’s commitment, he got the ticket.” In 2018, Tenginakayi had to withdraw his nomination from Kalghatgi constituency in Dharwad due to public opposition, said Shettar. Eventually, C M Nimbannavar won on a BJP ticket.The former CM alleged that Santhosh had plans to not field other senior leaders such as Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and S Suresh Kumar. But, fearing blowback over dropping several candidates, the central BJP leader was not able to execute it. Shettar claimed that in Mysuru former minister S A Ramdas was denied a ticket and T S Srivatsa who is close to Santhosh was nominated.Responding to the allegations, Tenginakayi said, “Santhoshji is a Sangh pracharak and working without any desires or aspirations. He does not pick and choose. Any one person cannot take such decisions in the party. Decisions are made by the BJP Parliamentary Board.”Must Read | BJP walks caste tightrope in Karnataka ticket allocation, tries to pacify groups unhappy about quota changesShettar’s allegations have put Santhosh back in the spotlight like in the past few elections. Santhosh and former Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa are known to have been involved in a feud when the former was the BJP general secretary (organisation) of the state unit. The differences between the two camps often came to the fore during the distribution of election tickets. According to party insiders, there has been speculation in the past about Santosh harbouring chief ministerial ambitions and cultivating his coterie of supporters in each district.In the past few years, as Yediyurappa’s influence over the state unit loosened, Santhosh, who hails from Karnataka, tried to assert himself. In the last few elections, such as the Rajya Sabha polls in 2020, Santhosh gained an upper hand as he secured tickets for candidates selected by him, much to the chagrin of some state leaders. For the coming polls too, Santhosh has succeeded in ensuring tickets to several of his loyalists.AdvertisementThough the list of candidates shows that Yediyurappa still continues to have his say in the affairs of the state unit, insiders say that the control of the state BJP office is now firmly in Santhosh’s hands. Shettar on Tuesday made this point, noting that BJP vice president Nirmal Kumar Surana whom Yediyurappa expelled in 2017 was reinstated two years later.Santhosh has been active in the run-up to the May 10 elections, holding meetings with the cadre of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in several parts of the state. Amid speculation that Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah of the Congress could contest from Kolar, he shifted his focus to the constituency and is learnt to have held strategy meetings. In the end, the Congress fielded Siddaramaiah from Varuna in Mysuru district and nominated Kothur G Manjunath from Kolar.Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru that it was Santhosh’s ploy to field minister V Somanna against him even though the Govindrajnagar MLA was not keen on contesting from Varuna."

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 03:01 pm | Updated 03:54 pm IST - BelagaviFormer Karnataka CM Jagadish Shettar, who quit the BJP to join the Congress, believes that he was denied the ticket to contest the Assembly elections by the machinations of party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh, who wanted to groom his supporters.“Mr Santosh saw to it that I did not get the BJP ticket, which went to his loyalist Mahesh Tenginakai instead. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told me that they were in my favour, but did not try hard enough,’‘ he told journalists in his home in Hubballi on April 18.In 2004, after Vijay Sankeshwar resigned from the party, Mr Shettar got a request from late Arun Jaitley, who was then handling Karnataka for the BJP, to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Dharwad. “But, I declined, as I was not interested in national politics. I suggested the name of Pralhad Joshi. I have campaigned harder for Mr Joshi than I have for myself. Now, I only ask Mr Joshi to recall this,’‘ he said.Asked if he would contest as a Congress candidate against Mr Joshi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mr Shettar said he would consider the possibility at the appropriate time.Coming back to Mr Santosh, he said, “Mr Santosh has been in charge of elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal. But he has not succeeded anywhere. I do not understand why the BJP high command trusts him so much with elections in Karnataka, or elsewhere.”BJP claims that party is more important than individuals, but is it?“BJP’s long-held motto has been that the party is more important than any individual. But with his consistent and well-planned actions, Mr Santosh has proved this is not true. Now, Karnataka BJP is in the clutches of a few persons whose writ runs in the party. There is no democratic decision-making in the party any more,’‘ Mr Shettar claimed.“However, mine is not an isolated case. Mr Santosh has been grooming an army of loyalists across Karnataka. He has toppled senior leaders, who had remained loyal to the BJP for decades, only to accommodate his favourites. Long-time leaders, who built the party with hard work, are being shown the door, only to be replaced by ‘yes men’. Even the BJP State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel is his man. Mr Santosh brought Mr Kateel into the core committee, and now, he has been continuing in his position (State unit president) even though his term is over. All this is only because he (Mr Kateel) obeys Mr Santosh. This will lead to weakening of the BJP’s base, and ultimate destruction of the party,’‘ Mr Shettar said.Misinformation campaign to weaken the case of sitting BJP MLAs“Mr Santosh has interfered in ticket distribution in several districts. He has been directing his followers in some constituencies to launch a misinformation campaign against popular leaders. In Hubballi, such a whisper campaign has been going on against me for 6-7 months. Some BJP workers were going around spreading rumours that I was not going to get the ticket this time, and that the decision had been taken by the BJP high command a long time ago. When I came to know of this campaign, I was surprised. How can the party deny the ticket to a six-time MLA who is also a former CM? I brought this to the notice of leaders like (Union Minister) Dharmendra Pradhan in the core committee meeting. But they did not take it seriously,” Mr Shettar said.“In Mysuru, Mr Santosh ensured that his loyalist Sri Vatsa got the ticket instead of S.A. Ramadas, MLA of Krishnaraja. Earlier, Mr Santosh had used another leader, H.V. Rajiv, to speak against Mr Ramadas openly. But the ticket went to Mr Sri Vatsa, and not Mr Rajiv. Some time ago, former minister (and Rajajinagar MLA) S. Suresh Kumar told me about a whisper campaign against him in his constituency.“Young and inexperienced leaders like former IPS officer Annamalai have been made joint in-charge of Karnataka while senior leaders like me are not consulted. That is only because Mr Annamalai is a loyalist of Mr Santosh.”Denial of ticket was not the only reason to leave BJPA visibly upset Mr Shettar reiterated that he was humiliated by the BJP leadership repeatedly.“It may seem that I am upset only because I was denied the ticket. That is not true. I was sidelined. My seniority was not respected, and I was thrown out of the party I built, without basic courtesy. But I kept quiet, as I had high regard for the party. But when they denied me a ticket without informing me beforehand, I could not take it any longer. It was as if the flood gates had opened,” he said.“I would have accepted if the party leaders had invited me to Delhi and intimated me of their decision to drop me. But that was not done. Some person called me on April 11, two days before beginning of filing of nominations and told me that I was not getting the ticket, and that I had to sign a printed form declaring that I had accepted the party’s decision. That was very insulting. I decided to change parties, to retain my self-respect. The only condition I have laid before the Congress is that I should be treated with the respect that I deserve.“Earlier, when leaders like (Union Ministers) Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in charge of Karnataka, they consulted us extensively. We were not consulted by the new dispensation for any important decisions. In the last three years, I was not allowed to speak even for five minutes in the BJP State executive committee, of which I am a long-standing member.”Not scared of I-T raid or EDHe is neither afraid of nor bothered about raids by the income tax department or the Enforcement Directorate. “My life is an open book. There are no dark spots in my 30-year political career. I do not own or run any illegal business. I am not an extremely wealthy man. I only have some limited assets that were created through legal means. Even if the I-T or ED officers raid them, they will not find anything amiss,” the former CM said.There is no confusion in his mind about his ideological suitability in the Congress. “I like to think about it like this — both are national parties that want to work for the poor and marginalised. I have always led a life of probity. I have always had people’s welfare on the top of my mind. I will continue to do that in this party,’‘ he said.CM confident that Jagadish Shettar’s exit will not push Lingayats away from BJPChief Minister Basavaraj Bommai denied the allegation that Mr Santosh had prevented Mr Shettar from getting the BJP ticket, or that the party is in the clutches of a clique.“The party high command is following some principles in the distribution of tickets. There are systems in place. It is a very open and democratic system. Our topmost leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a highly democratic leader,’‘ he told journalists in Mudhol in Bagalkot district.“Mr Shettar is complaining about centralisation of power, but was a centre of power till recently,” he said.The CM does not expect the exit of Mr Shettar or Laxman Savadi to alter the party’s Lingayat base. “Lingayats in Karnataka are vigilant. They take the right decision about various issues. The Congress, had tried to divide the Lingayat community, but is now showing unprecedented love for them. That is nothing, but opportunism,’‘ he said. “The BJP will win a majority of seats in northern Karnataka despite the exit of some leaders.”"

What I saw was, the person whom people respect and call him Santhosh ji, it's B L Santhosh, who is the root cause of all this, Shettar said in a press conference here.Explaining further, Shettar, the former Leader of Opposition, said he fell victim to the game played against him and added the ticket that was announced in his favour was taken back later, he charged.The BJP gave ticket to Tenginkai who worked for the party organisation. If the party wanted to honour him, it could have made him MLC or given some important post, Shettar, who was also a former Karnataka Assembly Speaker, said.He claimed that in the 2018 Assembly election, Channappa Nimbannanavar was a strong contender from Kalghatgi constituency in Dharwad district but the local leaders revolted. The party was compelled to field Nimbannanavar.The veteran leader accused Tenginkai of running a 'whispering campaign' against him over the past six to seven months.Stating that Santhosh has many 'Maanas Putras' (a person who is treated like a son), Shettar said: This Maanas Putra (Mahesh Tenginkai) started a whispering campaign with his disciples against me for the past six to seven months. A staunch RSS man, Shettar was part of the Jan Sangh and BJP for several decades before severing his ties with the party upon his candidature being overlooked for the May 10 election and joined Congress on Monday.Several attempts were made to persuade him by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Pralhad Joshi to stop him from going out of the party but he remained adamant of contesting the polls at any cost.Voting will take place in the state on May 10 and the results will be out on May 13."

                            "summary": "CBI can question Avinash, but can't arrest himThe Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) not to arrest Kadapa MP Y.S. Avinash Reddy in Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy murder case till April 25.In its interim order on anticipatory bail petition of the MP, the court directed him to appear before the CBI daily till April 25.The court also suggested to the CBI to audio and video record questioning of Avinash Reddy. The final order on the anticipatory bail plea will be delivered on April 25.The CBI informed the court that it will question Avinash Reddy in the presence of his father Y.S. Bhaskar Reddy and another accused Uday Kumar Reddy.Earlier, Avinash Reddy's counsel T. Niranjan Reddy told the court that except the statement of Dastagiri, an accused turned approver in the case, the CBI had no evidence against Avinash.He contended that Google Takeout data can't be relied on during the investigation.The MP's counsel also told the court that there is a contradiction between Dastagiri's statement about another accused Sunil Yadav's movements and Google Takeout data. He argued that family problems, financial disputes or extramarital relations could be the reason for the murder.On the CBI suspecting Avinash's role in disappearance of evidence, the MP's counsel submitted that since Avinash is a relative of the victim, he went to the house and helped in cleaning the room.On the central agency's argument that Avinash Reddy spread the word that Vivekananda Reddy died of cardiac arrest, his lawyer clarified that he only repeated what he had heard from others at the house.The CBI opposed the anticipatory bail on the ground that it has to collect more information from him and that he is an influential person. It also told the court that during his appearance before it four times, he did not cooperate.The CBI counsel also argued that Avinash Reddy had knowledge of murder conspiracy and it gathered scientific and technical evidence. He also clarified that there is no evidence of financial disputes or extramarital relations.The CBI counsel also informed that the weapons used in the murder had not yet been recovered. After the murder, the accused had gone to Avinash Reddy's house with weapons.Counsel of Vivekananda Reddy's daughter Suneetha Reddy, who had impleaded in the case, argued that Avinash Reddy was approaching courts whenever the CBI was issuing notices to him. Accused and witnesses have already told the CBI about the role of Avinash Reddy.The MP fears arrest in the case as his father Y.S. Bhaskar Reddy was arrested in the case on Sunday. In its petition seeking custody of Bhaskar Reddy, the CBI had named Avinash Reddy as co-accused.Bhaskar Reddy, who was arrested in Pulivendula on Sunday, was brought to Hyderabad and produced before a magistrate, who remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.Meanwhile, the CBI court in Hyderabad on Tuesday sent Bhaskar Reddy and another accused Uday Kumar Reddy to CBI custody for six days. The accused are currently lodged in Chanchalguda Jail in Hyderabad.The CBI has directed Avinash Reddy to appear before it on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. The agency has conveyed to the court that it will question him in the presence of Bhaskar Reddy and Uday Kumar Reddy.Avinash Reddy, cousin of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, has been questioned by the CBI four times during the last couple of months.Vivekananda Reddy, brother of former chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and uncle of Jagan Mohan Reddy, was found murdered at his residence in Pulivendula of Kadapa district on the night of March 15, 2019, a few days before the elections.The 68-year-old former state minister and former MP was alone at his house when unidentified persons barged in and killed him.The CBI took over the investigation into the case in 2020 on the direction of Andhra Pradesh High Court while hearing a petition of Vivekananda Reddy's daughter Suneetha Reddy, who raised suspicion about some relatives.The Supreme Court transferred the case to Hyderabad in November last year while observing that doubts raised by Suneetha Reddy about getting a fair trial and investigation in Andhra Pradesh were reasonable."

Avinash Reddy was scheduled to depose before the CBI and face questions on his alleged attempt to destroy evidence at the crime scene on the morning of March 15, 2019. However, his advocates sought time, citing the hearing on his anticipatory bail plea in HC.The MP’s counsel, T Niranjan Reddy , said the probe agency had summoned them as witnesses, but was resorting to sudden arrests by overnight converting their status to accused. “CBI, ironically, is doing all this based on a statement by Shaik Dastagiri , a hired assassin who later turned approver. It is believing his false theories,” he said, objecting to the way the MP’s father was arrested and sent to jail."

                            "summary": "Why is the BJP using the CBI to pursue Jagan?The CBI is knocking on the doors of AP Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy's close family members in connection with the murder of former minister Y S Vivekananda Reddy.The CBI officials have picked up Jagan's uncle, Y S Bhaskara Reddy, and sent him to judicial remand in the Chanchalguda Central jail.The CBI has summoned Jagan's cousin and Kadapa MP, Y S Avinash Reddy, for questioning and is likely to arrest him too.Despite repeated allegations of a misleading investigation and missing key points in the murder, including a letter found by Viveka's body, the CBI is pursuing the case.Avinash Reddy has also alleged that the CBI is investigating the case solely to frame him and absolve themselves of responsibility.Whatever the reasons, the CBI seems intent on apprehending Avinash Reddy, who is a close cousin of Jagan Mohan Reddy.One wonders why the CBI has suddenly picked up the pace in dealing with Jagan Mohan Reddy.Sources suggest that BJP leaders had asked Jagan for open support in the Karnataka Assembly elections, which he refused. The BJP leaders also reportedly asked Jagan to campaign for the BJP in Karnataka, but he refused that as well.In an attempt to exert pressure on Jagan to meet their political needs, the BJP is tightening the screws around him, according to sources.If the reports are to be believed, Jagan Mohan Reddy is the kind of leader who does not compromise on his decisions and will not yield to pressure.If that is the case, he would not have gone to jail when the Congress leadership pressured him.Are the BJP leaders listening?"

My family is aware of his condition, he said, asserting that he had no differences with his father.He said the episode was an attempt to malign Abhishek Banerjee, referring to the Trinamool Congress MP who is the nephew of Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Mr Roy, a former number two in the Trinamool, joined the BJP in 2017 following differences with Mamata Banerjee. He was made BJP national vice president. He won the 2021 Bengal assembly polls on a BJP ticket.Later, as several Trinamool defectors returned to the party, Mr Roy also rejoined his former party along with his son."

                            "summary": "Guwahati: A fresh scandal has hit the Congress. Assam Youth Congress chief Dr Angkita Dutta has accused the youth wing’s national president Srinivas BV of harassing her for the past six months, discriminating against her for “being a woman” and using foul language to destroy her image.Speaking exclusively to Firstpost, Angkita Dutta said she felt disappointed in her party’s leadership for not taking any action against Srinivas BV despite knowing full well what was going on. “I went to Jammu to participate in the Bharat Jodo Yatra and had then, in person, apprised Rahul Gandhi about the misdeeds of Srinivas BV. I expect my leadership to stand by women, but I am appalled at the high command’s inaction.”Angkita Dutta claimed that her harassment started after she raised her voice against the mismanagement of Indian Youth Congress affairs by Srinivas, which also included discrimination against her since “I am a woman”.“He went on saying that I am an alcoholic. He undermined my existence because of being a woman. At the Rampur session, I was going inside the Mayfair hotel to meet seniors, while Srinivas was on his way out. As he crossed me he asked: ‘What alcohol do you drink? Do you text after drinking?”. Two of my colleagues were witness to this, Angkita claimed.Meanwhile, despite repeated calls and messages, Srinivas BV did not respond to Firstpost queries in the matter.Tagging Rahul Gandhi on a tweet, she also accused the incumbent national president of IYC Srinivas BV for not “mentally harassing and discriminating” her for past six months and asking her to remain silent on the issue.“Despite my complaints, no enquiry committee has been initiated against Srinivas BV. Is this the safe space @RahulGandhi talks about women @priyankagandhi,” she said.Came out because of #MeToo“When previous Indian Youth Congress President Keshav Kumar had sexually harassed and because of #MeToo came out. He was compelled to remove. Now despite being mentally harassed and discriminated by Srinivas BV for 6 months. I have been told to keep Mum and no enquiry is initiated,” Dr Angkita Dutta, president of Assam Pradesh Youth Congress (IYC Assam) said.She said she was “keeping quite” for the sake of Congress, “but harassment doesn’t stop by Srinivas BV”.‘Discriminated on basis of gender’Angkita Dutta further accused Srinivas BV for “continually harassed me and was discriminating on the basis of my gender.”Attacking Rahul Gandhi, Angkita Dutta said: “My values and education doesn’t allow me anymore. The leadership has played deaf ears despite bring front of them MANY TIMES @RahulGandhi @kcvenugopalmp @priyankagandhi.”Srinivas has blessings of big leadersShe further accused Srinivas BV saying that he “thinks he is so powerful and has the blessing of big leaders that he can harass and demean a woman in the organisation.”She also asked Rahul and Priyanka, “I am a woman leader. If I undergo such harassment, how am I suppose to encourage woman to join the Congress party.”Had faith in Rahul GandhiAngkita Dutta said that she had a lot of faith in Rahul Gandhi and she even went to Jammu during Jammu during his Bharat Jodo Yatra “to appraise him of Srinivas’ harassment and demeaning use of language towards me. It’s April now and still no equity against him.”Is Congress safe for women?“I have kept quiet for months waiting for them to take action against him yet no one seems interested. Srinivas in the guise of his PR is getting away with all kind of wrong doings,” Angkita Dutta said.She said that despite complaints, no enquiry committee has been initiated against Srinivas. “Is this the safe space,” she asked.“How can a sexist and chauvinistic lead @IYC torture and demean a woman every single time. What happened to Priyanka Gandhi ‘Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon’ (I’m a girl, I can fight) campaign,” she asked.However, Srinivas BV retweeted a post by IYC Legal Cell, which in a post said: “Dr. Dutta has resorted to using utterly unparliamentary, undignified, defamatory, malicious words against @IYC President @srinivasiyc ji & has levelled totally frivolous allegations against him. The @IYCLegalCell is initiating strongstringent legal action in respect of the same.”Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News,India News and Entertainment News here.

                            "summary": "“Iss House mein kah raha hoon, iss mafia ko mitti mein mila denge,” said Yogi Adityanath in the UP assembly on February 25, following the killing of Umesh Pal, a witness in the 2005 Raju Pal murder the previous dayMeanwhile Atiq Ahmed, gangster-turned-politician, five-time MLA, ex-Member of Parliament, accused in over 100 cases was being held in Gujarat’s Sabarmati Jail. Yogi’s police moved to bring Atiq to UP for the Umesh Pal murder investigation. In the context of Adityanath’s statement, Atiq feared the UP police would kill him in a fake encounter on any pretext — that handing him over to them would be a virtual death warrant — and he moved the Supreme Court seeking protection. The Supreme Court on March 28 refused to entertain his plea, assuring him that the “state machinery will take care” and asked him to approach the High Court instead.Atiq and his brother Ashraf were moved to Allahabad under very high security with a huge posse of armed police. On April 13, Atiq’s son Asad and an aide, both accused in the same Umesh Pal murder case, were shot dead in Jhansi in an “encounter” by the Special Task Force of the UP police.Atiq applied for permission to attend his son’s burial. He was refused. On the night of April 15, at about 10:30 pm, Atiq and Ashraf were taken by the police for a medical checkup to the Allahabad Medical College. As they stepped out of the ramshackle police jeep, handcuffed to each other but surrounded very loosely by only about 15-20 policemen quite a distance away from the hospital gate, media cameras were thrust at their faces. It is clear from the live TV footage that the media accessed the area around Atiq completely unchecked and unhindered by the police, in total contrast to the high threat perception around the duo. They asked him about his absence at his son’s burial: “Nahi le gaya toh nahi gaye”. They didn’t take me so we didn’t go, said Atiq.Moments later, three young men accompanied by an outdated, oversized TV camera pumped a volley of bullets into Atiq and Ashraf at point blank range, killing them both. The boys chanted, “Jai Shri Ram” as they were overpowered by policemen. The police, notably, did not fire back. They also did not ask for police custody but were happy to allow judicial remand, clearly implying that the double murder in full public glare needed no investigation whatsoever.The above are the bare facts surrounding the murder of Atiq and Ashraf Ahmed while in the custody of the UP police. Additionally, the protocol for high-security prisoners was not followed as is evident from the reduced security detail during the hospital visit in the public footage available. If the police were unarmed, it was a violation of SOP, and if they were armed then there was no reason to not fire back at the killers especially since only a day before, the very same police had killed Atiq’s son and aide for firing at the police. The presence of the media with unfettered access to dangerous high-security prisoners also raises questions as to whether they were tipped off about the late-night hospital visit. The timing of the medical examination at 10:30 pm itself raises suspicions about whether or not this was a staged killing.Also in Express Opinion | The ‘suraksha’ story: How police encounters are justified in Uttar PradeshFollowing on, let us make no mistake — this was a custodial death. But even in a country like India with a history of brutal custodial deaths, for the first time perhaps, this is a death where a third party has killed a person whilst in police custody. The state is responsible for every custodial death. The question this time is, did the state actively chart out a strategy to eliminate the men in custody, by cutting short the due process of law?AdvertisementPresumption of innocence is a facet of the right to life. In this case, though, there is not merely a violation of the presumption, but of the actual right to life. Convicts do not lose their fundamental rights. The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 is itself a fundamental right, one that Ambedkar called the soul of the Constitution. Atiq exercised this right when he approached the Supreme Court. The Court is the guardian of all rights, but the most basic human right to life is put on a special pedestal. To have relegated him to the High Court when there was an imminent threat to his life was an abdication of constitutional responsibility.Social media is abuzz with the saffron ecosystem celebrating how, finally, we have in Yogi Adityanath a leader who does what he promises. “Bada mazaa aaya” — it was great fun watching. “Sabak sikha diya humne toh” — “we” taught “them” a lesson. It is this descent into a mobocracy that is truly frightening. When the blood lust of a mob is being fed by a state under the mistaken illusion that it will ensure its political continuity, there is absolutely nothing preventing it from disbanding the courts and eliminating due process of law.Every senior journalist while commenting on the incident prefaces their statement with, “I have no love for Atiq”. But that’s not the point. Even the most dreaded criminal is constitutionally protected under Article 21, which states that no person shall be deprived of his life and liberty except by procedure established by law. Our abhorrence for Atiq’s crimes must lead to a robust prosecution of the same, not to his elimination through extra legal means. The death of these men in public view is as abhorrent as the crimes they allegedly committed. Atiq was serving a life term for a crime he was tried and convicted of. It is a blot on India’s constitutional democracy that he was killed for a crime he was yet to be tried for. India as a nation must see Atiq’s murder for what it is — a descent into mobocracy.The writer is a Trinamool Congress MP"

The senior party leader, who served as housing and infrastructure development minister is the outgoing cabinet, was also the minister in-charge of Mysuru district.Visuals showed villagers surrounding the minister and asking questions about development in the constituency. Several BJP leaders, including Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, were seen trying to intervene. They were also seen asking people not to record the exchange between Mr Somanna and the villagers.Elected from Govindraj Nagar Assembly constituency in the 2018 election, Mr Somanna has been fielded from two seats this time -- Varuna and Chamarajanagara.A former Congress leader who switched to the BJP in 2009, Mr Somanna faces the formidable Siddaramaiah in Varuna. The seat, ever since it was formed in 2008, has backed the Congress veteran, sending him and then his son Yathindra Siddaramaiah to the Assembly. The Congress veteran is one of the frontrunners for the Chief Minister post if the party wins the polls and his supporters will leave no stone unturned to ensure his victory in Varuna.The BJP, however, is confident that Mr Somanna will beat the Congress heavyweight.Addressing a party meeting in support of the BJP leader, Chief Minister Basavaraj S Bommai said Mr Somanna is a model for development.The name of Varuna will go beyond the Mysuru district and he got the blessings of the Goddess Chamundeshwari. V Somanna means 'Victory' Somanna. A lot of changes have taken place in Karnataka politics. A few enjoyed power in the name of oppressed classes. They grew in politics but the community remained backward, he said.The BJP also aims to tap into the Lingayat voter base in Varuna by fielding Mr Somanna, who is from the community.The senior leader recently told the media that the Varuna constituency was not new for him because he had campaigned for Siddaramaiah during the bypolls at Chamundeshwari in Mysuru, back when they were in the same party. I will do my job, he was quoted as saying in a report by news agency PTI.The Congress veteran, too, is sure of a win. I will win with people's support. Let Somanna or anybody contest against me... I am not worried about the opponent as I have full faith in the people of Varuna, Mr Siddaramaiah said."

Former CM Siddaramaiah, who was earlier elected twice after it was carved out of Chamundeshwari and T Narasipura segments, has returned to the constituency to contest the 2023 election. His son Yathindra Siddaramaiah was elected from Varuna in 2018 and he has now paved the way to his father.Lingayats, who have been demanding political parties to field a community leader in Mysuru, are hoping that parties will field another Lingayat from Krishnaraja segment.The last time Mysuru, which currently has 11 assembly segments, elected a Lingayat leader was in 1999. Guruswamy AS, a Congress leader from Chamundeshwari, and HC Basavaraju, a BJP leader, were elected from Mysuru more than two decades ago. Since then, no Lingayat leader has been elected from the district despite they being the deciding factors in two-three constituencies.H Gangadharan, who was elected from Krishnaraja in Mysuru city in 1978 (from JNP) and 1983 (BJP) was a prominent Lingayat leader. The district had elected Rajashekar Murthy in 1989 from Chamundeshwari.Akhila Bharat Veerashaiva Mahasabha national committee executive member TS Lokesh told TOI that the community members are happy and thanked BJP for fielding a strong and veteran leader like Somanna from Varuna. “We were expecting local leaders to be fielded. We will however work for his victory by taking all the sections of society into confidence,” he said.“We have been requesting all parties to field Lingayat leaders. Except Congress, both BJP and JD(S) have been giving tickets to Lingayats for the assembly elections in the recent past. Even some Congress leaders from the community are unhappy with their leaders as they are still dilly-dallying in announcing candidates for Krishnaraja, which is currently represented by SA Ramadas, a Brahmin,” he said.BJP has fielded three Lingayat leaders in Chamarajanagar district – Gundlupet (CS Niranjana), Hanur (Preetham Nagappa), and Chamarajanagar (V Somanna), while Congress has fielded HS Mahadevaprasad’s son Ganesh Prasad, a Lingayat."

Mr. Siddaramaiah became the Chief Minister after his victory from Varuna.Mr. Siddaramaiah had contested from Chamundeshwari and Badami in the 2018 elections but he won from Badami and lost to JD(S) candidate and one-time associate G.T. Deve Gowda in Chamundeshwari. The former CM had won five times from Chamundeshwari in his political career spanning over four decades.The party workers are excited here with the former CM shifting to his home constituency. His birthplace, Siddaramanahundi, falls under Varuna.Mr. Siddaramaiah has announced that it is his last election and expressed confidence of romping home comfortably despite BJP fielding Housing Minister V. Somanna, an MLA from Govindarajanagar in Bengaluru, against him as part of the party’s strategy to give tough fight to its opponents in the Congress, including KPCC chief D.K. Shivakumar in Kanakapura where Revenue Minister R. Ashok is the fray.A grand roadshow is expected to unfold when Mr. Siddaramaiah goes to file his papers for the seat at the RO’s office in Nanjangud. Senior leaders from the district are expected to accompany Mr. Siddaramaiah, who is an aspirant for the CM’s post.The constituency from where the former CM would be contesting had become a big debate ahead of the ticket announcement since Mr. Siddaramaiah had himself admitted that he had offers to contest from many constituencies but had expressed his wish to contest from Kolar. But the party decided to field him from Varuna and none in the Congress have been fielded from two seats in the ensuing elections."

Last we saw the unannounced phone appear with the SM-M546BDS model number in a certificate filing, as well as on official support pages in Bangladesh, India and Levant. All in all, the F54 5G seems right around the corner. According to an industry insider source, Indian buyers can expect to see the handset hit shelves in the last week of April.Samsung Galaxy F54 5GThe source also reaffirms some of the specs for the F54 5G. As expected, it is quite similar to the Galaxy M54. The F54 5G is a rather hefty 199-gram, 8.4mm thick device with a massive 6,000 mAh battery and 25W Samsung fast charging. The list of specs also includes a 6.7-inch, FHD+, 120Hz Super AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top.Powering the F54 5G is Samsung’s new mid-range Exynos 1380 chipset, with an undisclosed amount of LPDDR4X RAM (likely 8GB) and UFS 2.2 storage (probably 128GB or 256GB and likely expandable via microSD). The chipset brings support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3. In the camera department, the F54 5G is said to rock a 108MP main snapper, 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro cam, along with a 32MP selfie cam.Design-wise, the F54 5G looks identical to the rest of Samsung’s current lineup with the signature separate trio of cameras on the back. There is no word on pricing yet, but we expect something similar to the Galaxy M54 in this department as well.Source"

This will be a huge move by Apple as the consumer-focused MacBook Air introduced by the tech giant allows consumers to own a Mac with similar levels of performance as the Intel-powered Pro devices.When it comes to price point, Apple's MacBook Air laptops are a huge hit with consumers. The only drawback for the Air was its screen size limited to 13-inches.So Apple has had a pressure to launch a larger 15-inch MacBook Air for a while now, and as per latest reports, Apple is likely to unveil the larger laptop at the company's annual developer's conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) scheduled to be held between June 5-9.To meet the deadline, Apple is speeding up the testing process for the much-anticipated 15-inch MacBook Air, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported, adding that the upcoming laptops will come packed with chips that will be as powerful as the M2 chip in MacBook Pro models.The report says that the developer logs show that there is a MacBook with a higher and larger resolution display with a chip that we have already seen in current Apple laptops.This yet-to-be named MacBook has been given the codename of 'Mac15,3', the report further added.Gurman further points out the upcoming MacBook will come with M2 chip as the laptop's speculated features include 8 crores and a 10-crore graphic processor, similar to specifications of the M2 chip.The report suggests that the 15-inch MacBook Air would come with the same screen resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. It is also important to note that speculations also suggest that Apple will be teasing its first mixed-reality headsets at the WWDC 2023 event.So it'll be interesting to see what all Apple has in store for us."

                            "summary": "Reports emerged yesterday that Samsung is considering replacing Google with Bing as the default search provider on its devices.However, those concerns may be unwarranted.Samsung can’t drop Google as its preferred default search engine, at least not in the US, because of Google’s Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA).Google’s MADA requires all Android original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to pre-install Google Search and use it as the default.Smartphone manufacturers who refuse to sign the MADA, such as Huawei, can’t use the Google Play Store and Android platform.Andreas Proschofsky, Editor at Der Standard, took to Twitter to clarify the situation.Why Samsung Can’t Drop GoogleProschofsky highlights that most countries require Google Search as the default search engine, as per the MADA.Android OEMs have to sign a thing called Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) if they want to get a license to use the Play Store and other Google apps. This includes a bunch of rules which includes – in most countries – setting Google Search as default. — Andreas Proschofsky (@suka_hiroaki) April 17, 2023Proschofsky’s thread continues:“Android OEMs have to sign a thing called “Mobile Application Distribution Agreement” (MADA) if they want to get a license to use the Play Store and other Google apps. This includes a bunch of rules which includes – in most countries – setting Google Search as default. If you don’t do that, you simply won’t get the Play Store and other Google apps. You might like this or not. Or even find this highly problematic. But those are Googles standing rules in return for giving Android and its services away for free. So if Samsung would switch to Bing that would mean: no Play Store, no Gmail, no Maps, no you name it. So basically going the Huawei route. I doubt that Samsung wants to do that. Now about that “most” countries reference: In Europe and India things are a bit different as regulators have struck down that default search requirement. But that also means that Samsung “switching” to Bing wouldn’t amount to much. In all those countries users are already presented with a mandatory search engine choice screen during setup of Android devices. So there simply is no default to switch to anymore. So where is that rumor coming from? It could be a simple misunderstanding. It could be Samsung trying to do leak PR to get a better revenue sharing deal from Google. And there are definitely OTHER areas where Samsung could put pressure on Google. No doubt. But all of that is just speculation, nothing else. What’s not speculation are the licensing terms for Android OEMs. So don’t hold you breath for Bing being the default search on Samsung devices anytime soon.”What Else Is In Google’s MADA Agreement?Google’s MADA agreement (PDF link) sets forth strict conditions and requirements that Android OEMs must adhere to, including the following key provisions:Devices may only be distributed if all Google Applications are pre-installed (MADA section 2.1).The phone manufacturer must preload all Google Applications approved in the applicable territory on each device (MADA section 3.4(1)).The phone manufacturer must place Google’s Search and the Android Market Client icon (Google Play) at least on the panel immediately adjacent to the Default Home Screen. All other Google Applications must be placed no more than one level below the Phone Top (MADA Section 3.4(2)-(3)).The phone manufacturer must set Google Search as the default search provider for all Web search access points (MADA Section 3.4(4)).Google’s Network Location Provider service must be preloaded on the device and set as the default (MADA Section 3.8(c)).In SummaryThe current rules for Android device makers make it unlikely that Samsung will drop Google as its default search provider in the US.The Google MADA ensures that Google Search stays the main search engine for most Android devices.A switch could happen in places like Europe and India, where the rules differ. However, that’s not expected to have as significant of an impact on Google’s market share.Featured Image: Ka IkiShutterstock"

                            "summary": "It’s the season of Artificial Intelligence, and everyone seems to be in a rush to build a god-like AI. The latest development this week calls attention to Alphabet Inc and its ambitious AI-driven projects. While it’s commonly known that Google has Bard chatbot and has been working on an array of AI products modelled around text-to-images and text-to-videos, now it seems Google is on its way to integrating some “radical” AI tools into its search engine.In another development, South Korean smartphone giant Samsung has replaced Google with Microsoft’s Bing as its default search engine on its line of devices. This has evidently ruffled some feathers, as Bing has been an optional search engine for years. Based on a report in The New York Times, the latest development prompted Alphabet to hit the “panic” button.Also Read | Google Chat gets a Material You makeover to match other Workspace appsBing and a slew of other AI-powered search engines seem to be giving Google sleepless nights. However, it has been reported that Google is now bracing itself to build an “all-new” search engine based on AI. Reportedly, the internal docs accessed by the media outlet show that Google is also updating its existing search engines with a slew of AI features. And all these new projects are being rolled out under the name Magi.What is project Magi?Google’s Project Magi is paving the way for a whole set of new features that are being steered by executives, designers, and engineers. All the stakeholders involved in Project Magi are currently working in “sprint mode.” Reportedly, the new search engine that is coming to shape under Google’s new project will give users a far more personalised experience than its existing version. It is believed that nearly 160 people are working full-time on the project.It is to be noted that these plans, purportedly seeking to reimagine the search experience, are in their nascent stages, and there is no clear timeline yet known about the potential announcements. The new system will learn what users are seeking after they begin using it. The new search will offer preselected options on what to shop for, information to look for, and other information from its learning. Reportedly, the new search experience will be more conversational, an experience similar to seeking the advice of a helpful person. In essence, Google’s new AI search will feature an interface similar to ChatGPT.As per the report, even before the search engine is modified, the Magi Project will see Google add some AI features to the existing search experience. Interestingly, search results and search queries will continue to lead to financial transactions and will feature ads. As of now, Google’s chatbot Bard does not feature ads. The new features will also help users get answers on coding and writing code based on their prompts.When to expect new search tools under Project Magi?The same report has stated that earlier this month, Google asked some of its staff to test features under Magi. It also encouraged the staff to ask follow-up questions to test the search’s ability to sustain conversations. If the report is to be believed, Google may unveil these tools to the public sometime in May.AdvertisementIt has been reported that Google plans to initially release the tools to one million users, progressively rolling out to up to 30 million by the end of 2023. As of now, it seems that these features will be exclusively available in the US.The key aspect of the latest AI search will be that Google will be abandoning the conventional way it displays search results. Currently, it shows 10 results on a search result page; however, with an AI chatbot, this could change as users will get instant answers.What will this mean for Google?The development comes at a time when Google is facing an array of issues. Samsung’s decision to switch from Google Search to Microsoft Bing seems to have set Google in motion. Additionally, the company has been battling economic slowdowns, antitrust investigations in the US and Europe, and issues pertaining to content moderation, among other challenges.AdvertisementIf the Magi project helps Google come back with force and assert its position as the leader in search, it could be a game changer. According to Jim Lecinski, Google’s Vice President of Sales and Services, as the leader in search, the company has been working to ensure that it is a participant in the ongoing AI race."

Google has long held an essential monopoly on the search market, commanding a market share of about 90%.And Alphabet is working hard to defend its market share, according to the report, with a team of more than 160 people working to incorporate artificial intelligence features into its Google search product.But that might not be enough if Samsung decides to set Bing as the default search engine across the hundreds of millions of devices it ships each year. While Google could still be made the primary search engine on Samsung devices if a deal between Samsung and Microsoft goes through, it would require users to change the phone settings on their own to make the change.Samsung has a long standing relationship with both Alphabet and Microsoft, as it pre-installs various apps from both companies on its devices, and negotiations between Samsung and Microsoft are still ongoing and could still end up with Google as its default provider, according to the report.But the report highlights just how much is at stake for Alphabet to defend its market share in search and regain its competitiveness in the generative AI search market, at which ChatGPT is thriving. An initial showcase of Google's answer to ChatGPT, dubbed Bard, was a flop."

Yes, according to Jon Prosser, Google will be unveiling its brand new foldable phone, Google Pixel Fold on May 10.The tech company will reportedly launch the smartphone in the global market on June 27, with the pre-booking opening from May 10 itself, the report added.It is also being reported that Google will be launching the Pixel 7a alongside the Pixel Fold. Prosser's claim was further backed by tech tipster Snoopy Tech who has reported that the pocket-friendly smartphone will arrive in the market in next 14 days.The budget-friendly smartphone, Google Pixel 7a , will come in four colour options: Charcoal, Snow, Sea (Light Blue) and Coral. The report further suggests that Google will not discontinue the Pixel 6a phone.Now talking about the pricing, the Google Pixel Fold will most likely be priced at $1,799, whereas the Google Pixel 7a may be available at a starting price of $499.We can also expect Google to launch both the smartphones with Google's Tensor G2 processor. So far we don't know the configurations of RAM, internal storage space and the pixels on the Google Pixel Fold and Google Pixel 7a.Meanwhile, several reports suggest that the upcoming Google Pixel 7a will flaunt the same display size as the Google Pixel 6a. The smartphone may offer a faster fingerprint scanner and refresh rate of 90Hz."

This phone is set to be the successor to Google’s Pixel 6a, arguably the best-value phone of 2022. Thanks to a retail source, we now have the price for Pixel 7a.9to5Google can confirm that the price of Pixel 7a will be $499, a $50 increase over last year’s model.Given Google’s history of providing incredible value products in the Pixel A-series, the $50 increase does seem to come at an interesting time, somewhat unfortunate time. As the economy is being more turbulent and phone prices seem to be on the rise, it would have been expected for Google to keep the same price as in previous years. So why the jump?This increase likely comes from the new design and improvements. Google is upgrading the main camera to a 64MP main sensor flanked by a 13MP ultrawide shooter. This is outside of the Tensor G2 SoC found in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, the new 90hz display, and the long-awaited addition of wireless charging. These improvements are likely coming at a cost, which, unfortunately, is resulting in a higher price to consumers.Luckily, Google isn’t getting rid of all low-price options. Google will be keeping the Pixel 6a on deck at a decreased price. While we don’t have any more information on the price drop or around this, we have confirmed it will happen.With the Pixel 7a just a few weeks out, we will likely get more details soon. Earlier today, Jon Prosser said that the Pixel 7a will be available for purchase on May 10, right after Google IO. While this is true, you will not be able to get it in-store or delivered until May 11, the street date for the device. Prosser also noted that the phone will be sold in a “Coral” color option solely on the Google Store, in addition to previously-leaked colors.More on Pixel 7a:"

In this condition, women experience irregular periods, hair fall, infertility, weight gain, mood swings and much more. The exact cause of PCOS is still unknown. If left uncontrolled, it can also lead to long-term complications such as Type-2 diabetes and an increased risk of heart disease. Along with medication, lifestyle changes play a major role in controlling PCOS and the complications associated with it. Weight loss, a healthy well-balanced diet and stress management are some of the ways to control PCOS symptoms.In one of her latest posts, nutritionist Lovneet Batra shares 3 simple tips that can help women with PCOS in more ways than one. Let's take a look at these.3 lifestyle changes to manage PCOS:1. Go for a walkIncreasing your overall physical activity helps women with PCOS in several ways. It helps in weight loss and controls the risk of developing complications associated with PCOS. The nutritionist recommends going for a walk for at least 30-45 minutes per day.2. Get some sunlightAccording to Batra, a good dose of natural light in the morning is good for those with PCOS.Sunlight helps boost the levels of vitamin D in the body. Your body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Studies have highlighted the role of vitamin D in PCOD management. Sufficient intake of vitamin D helps improve fertility, puts an individual in a better mood and reduces the risk of developing further diseases.3. Fix your sleep cycleInsufficient sleep can disturb your hormones and make you gain weight. Managing body weight is crucial for PCOS control. A healthy sleep cycle helps improve several symptoms and insulin resistance.Other than these you should also focus on weight management to control PCOS symptoms.Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

                            "summary": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, affects many women worldwide. PCOS leads to weight gain, acne, and irregular periods. While PCOS is a lifelong condition, its symptoms can be managed through various treatments, including medication, lifestyle changes, and regular exercise. Regular exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits for women suffering from PCOS. Here’s a look at the importance of exercise in managing PCOS symptoms and the different types of exercise that can be beneficial for women with PCOS.Improves insulin sensitivityWomen with PCOS are often insulin-resistant, meaning their bodies don’t respond well to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance is a significant contributing factor to the development of type 2 diabetes. Regular exercise, especially cardio, can improve insulin sensitivity, helping to prevent the onset of diabetes. Aids weight lossWeight gain is a common symptom of PCOS, and excess weight can exacerbate other symptoms such as irregular periods and acne. An exercise is a vital tool for weight loss, and regular physical activity can help women with PCOS to maintain a healthy weight. Losing even a small amount of weight can have significant benefits for PCOS management, such as improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the risk of other health conditions. Reduces the risk of diabetesType 2 diabetes is more likely to affect women with PCOS. Exercise can help to reduce this risk by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss. Improves cardiovascular healthWomen with PCOS are also at an increased risk of developing heart disease. Regular exercise can lower this risk by strengthening the cardiovascular system. Exercise strengthens the heart and reduces the risk of high blood pressure and other heart-related conditions. Cardiovascular health can be significantly impacted by even light exercise, like walking. Helps manage stress and mood disordersPCOS can cause mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, which can be debilitating for some women. Regular exercise is an effective way to manage stress and improve mood. Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, which are natural mood boosters, and can help women with PCOS feel more relaxed and less anxious.Different types of exerciseWomen with PCOS can benefit from a variety of different types of exercise. Here are some examples:Cardiovascular Exercise: Cardiovascular or aerobic exercise is any exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate. Cardiovascular exercise is particularly effective for improving insulin sensitivity, reducing blood sugar levels, and promoting weight loss. Strength Training: Strength training involves working your muscles against resistance, such as lifting weights or using resistance bands. Strength training helps to build muscle mass, which in turn increases your metabolism and burns more calories. It can also help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): HIIT incorporates short bursts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with rest intervals or lower-intensity exercise. HIIT is particularly effective for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity. However, it may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with joint problems or who are new to exercise. Yoga: Yoga is a form of exercise that focuses on breathing, stretching, and relaxation. It can help to reduce stress levels, which is important for managing PCOS symptoms. Certain yoga poses, such as the reclining bound angle pose, can also help to stimulate the ovaries and regulate menstrual cycles. Pilates: Pilates is a form of exercise that focuses on core strength, posture, and balance. It involves a series of controlled movements that engage the muscles of the abdomen, hips, and back. Pilates can help to improve posture, reduce back pain, and promote weight loss.It’s important to pay attention to your body’s signals and refrain from overexerting yourself. Whenever you feel pain or discomfort while exercising, stop and take a break.Read all the Latest Lifestyle News here"

                            "summary": "PCOS and mental health are two topics that are increasingly coming into focus, as researchers and medical professionals recognize the significant impact PCOS can have on a woman's mental well-being. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects up to 10% of women of reproductive age.It can cause a range of physical symptoms, from irregular periods and acne to weight gain and infertility. However, what's less known is the fact that PCOS can also have a profound effect on mental health, causing issues like anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia.The link between PCOS and mental health is complex and multifaceted. Women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues than those without the condition. For example, studies have shown that women with PCOS are more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression.PCOS and mental health: Understanding the link and finding support (Image via Pexels)That's apparently due in part to the hormonal imbalances that accompany PCOS, and physical symptoms that can impact self-esteem and body image. Additionally, women with PCOS are more likely to develop eating disorders and body dysmorphia, as they struggle with weight gain and changes to their physical appearance.All these factors can lead to feelings of low self-worth, isolation and a reduced quality of life. As such, it's essential that women with PCOS receive adequate support and treatment to address their mental health needs.In this article, we explore the link between PCOS and mental health, discuss the ways in which PCOS can impact mental well-being and look at what can be done to manage and treat these issues.Link between PCOS and mental healthThe mind-body connection: PCOS and mental health (Image via Pexels)1) PCOS and anxietyAnxiety is a common mental health issue for women with PCOS, and it can be caused by a variety of factors. For example, hormonal imbalances can contribute to anxiety symptoms, as can the physical symptoms of PCOS, like weight gain, acne and excess hair growth.Additionally, the impact that PCOS can have on fertility and self-esteem can be a significant source of anxiety for many women. To manage anxiety related to PCOS, women may benefit from therapy, which can help them develop coping strategies and build resilience.Medications like antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs may also be helpful, depending on the severity of symptoms. It's important for women with PCOS and anxiety to seek support and treatment, as untreated anxiety can lead to other issues, like depression and social isolation.2) PCOS and depressionDepression is another common mental health issue for women with PCOS and can be caused by many of the same factors that contribute to anxiety.For example, hormonal imbalances can affect mood, and the physical symptoms of PCOS can impact self-esteem and overall well-being. Depression can also be linked to the challenges of managing PCOS, like following a strict diet and exercise regimen.To manage depression related to PCOS, women may benefit from therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. It's important for women to seek treatment for depression, as untreated depression can lead to other issues, like social isolation, reduced quality of life and even suicidal ideation.3) PCOS and body dysmorphiaFinding support: Coping with PCOS (Image via Pexels)Body dysmorphia is a condition in which a person has a distorted view of their body, often fixating on perceived flaws or imperfections.Women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing body dysmorphia, as the physical symptoms of PCOS can impact self-esteem and body image. For example, weight gain and excess hair growth can be particularly challenging for many women with PCOS.To manage body dysmorphia related to PCOS, women may benefit from therapy, which can help them develop a more positive body image and learn to cope with negative thoughts and feelings. Additionally, women may benefit from support groups or online communities, which can provide a sense of belonging and help them feel less isolated in their experiences.4) PCOS and eating disordersEating disorders are another common issue for women with PCOS, particularly those who struggle with weight gain and body image issues. Eating disorders can take many forms, from binge eating to restrictive eating, and can have serious consequences for physical and mental health.To manage eating disorders related to PCOS, women may benefit from therapy, which can help them develop a healthier relationship with food and body image. Additionally, women may benefit from working with a registered dietician, who can provide personalized guidance on nutrition and meal planning.It's important for women with PCOS and eating disorders to seek treatment, as these conditions can have long-term health consequences if left untreated.5) PCOS and insomniaPCOS and mental health (Image via Pexels)Insomnia, or difficulty sleeping, is a common issue for women with PCOS, and it can have a significant impact on mental health.Hormonal imbalances and physical symptoms of PCOS, like pain and discomfort, can make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Additionally, the stress and anxiety related to managing PCOS can contribute to insomnia.To manage insomnia related to PCOS, women may benefit from practicing good sleep hygiene, like avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime and establishing a regular sleep routine.Additionally, relaxation techniques, like meditation and deep breathing exercises, can be helpful in promoting relaxation and sleep. If insomnia persists, women may benefit from medication or cognitive behavioral therapy. That can help them develop healthy sleep habits and manage any underlying anxiety or stress.6) PCOS and self-careSelf-care is an important aspect of managing PCOS and promoting mental health. Women with PCOS may struggle with feelings of guilt or shame related to their condition, and taking time for self-care can help counteract these negative feelings. Self-care can take many forms, from exercise and healthy eating to engaging in hobbies and spending time with loved ones.It's important for women with this syndrome to understand the PCOS and mental health connection, and to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that promote their physical and mental well-being. Additionally, seeking support from loved ones and mental health professionals can be an important part of self-care for women with PCOS.PCOS and mental health (Image via Pexels)It's important to recognize that PCOS and mental health are interrelated. Women with PCOS may experience a range of mental health issues, from anxiety and depression to body dysmorphia and eating disorders. It's crucial for women with PCOS to prioritize their mental health and seek support and treatment as needed. This may include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes and self-care practices.By addressing the connection between PCOS and mental health, healthcare providers can better support women with this condition. Improved education and awareness can help women with PCOS feel more empowered to seek support for their mental health needs.It's important to recognize that mental health is a crucial component of overall health and well-being. Women with PCOS deserve access to high-quality care that addresses both their physical and mental health needs.Poll : 0 votes"

                            "summary": "PCOS has become dangerously common, and it can be challenging to manage. Research has shown that exercising regularly and managing your diet are key ways to help cope with stubborn PCOS symptoms.Anavi Someshwar, a fitness expert, and founder of ‘Hack Your Hormones,’ a program designed to sync with a woman’s menstrual phases, recommended a workout routine for people with PCOS.“Exercising can be difficult for women with PCOS because of insulin resistance. The body’s ability to use energy and effectively burn calories reduces. However, despite that, it’s incredibly integral for women with PCOS to participate in some sort of strength or resistance training activities at least thrice a week for 40 mins. It’s also a good idea to mix this up with cardio. Pilates works phenomenally too,” she explained.“Mind-body exercise like yoga is essential as well. Managing stress levels is a good goal to have since stress worsens PCOS. Strength training using weights or your own body weight can combat insulin resistance,” the expert added.According to The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a lack of physical activity and excess body weight has been linked to insulin resistance. However, a literature review of studies published in the journal called Sports Medicine states that one specific exercise type has not been found to be the most helpful to women with PCOS.For women with PCOS, Healthline recommends HIIT workouts (high-intensity interval training), which involve having intense exercise bursts such as burpees, tuck jumps, and mountain climbers, along with a few rest intervals to balance it out.Just as the expert recommends, strength training can be incredibly helpful too. This type of exercise involves using resistance bands, weights, or your own body weight to build muscle.AdvertisementSomeshwar urged people to find out what works for them. “There are as many options. If you don’t want to go to the gym, you can do workouts from Youtube at home. You can even dance if you enjoy that — that counts as cardio. If you get bored of exercising easily, use a combination of different types of exercise methods.

                            "summary": "World Liver Day is celebrated on April 19 every year to spread awareness about the importance of liver health and educate people on how to maintain a healthy liver. Liver diseases are known to develop silently with no visible symptoms until the disease has advanced. Diseases like Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are now affecting people more than ever before. According to an estimate by WHO, between 1990 to 2017, there has been a 100% increase in the incidence of new liver cancer cases, two-thirds of which are attributable to viral hepatitis, and 16% due to unknown causes, including NAFLD. (Also read: Fatty liver: 3 easy exercises, 6 lifestyle changes to reverse liver disease) While fatty liver disease is often asymptomatic, some signs can indicate the presence of the disease(Freepik)Liver is a crucial organ that performs numerous essential functions in the body, including detoxification of harmful substances, production of bile to aid in digestion, and regulation of metabolism. Hence, taking care of this organ is crucial to prevent liver-related diseases. Preventing or managing metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol well could prevent NAFLD risk.One of the most common liver diseases is fatty liver disease, which affects millions of people around the world. Fatty liver disease occurs when there is an accumulation of fat in the liver, which can cause inflammation and damage to the liver tissue in advance stages. While fatty liver disease is often asymptomatic, some signs can indicate the presence of the disease, says Dr Amit Miglani - Director & HOD – Gastroenterology, Asian Hospital Faridabad.Non-alcoholic associated fatty liver disease is now a modern day non-communicable pandemic akin to Covid-19 and a major lifestyle disorder of modern age, major risk factors being sedentary lifestyle and faulty dietary practices. Unfortunately, not many symptoms or signs are seen on face, skin or eyes in the initial stages of the disease and by the time signs appear it would have already turned into advanced liver disease, says Dr Vinit Shah, Consultant Liver Transplant Physician & Hepatologist at Ruby Hall clinic.Very often you won't get any features of fatty liver on your face, eyes or skin. But we can get certain hints in some of the people. If somebody has darkening of the skin on the neck, which typically what is called as a nape of the neck, that indicates insulin resistance, and that would almost always be associated with fatty liver. Similarly, if there's darkening of the skins, in your armpits, or in the groins, those are also indications that the person may have a fatty liver, says Dr Akash Shukla, Director & Consultant, Department of Hepatology, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai.Additionally, excessive chubbiness on the face or other parts of the body indicates that the person is likely to have fatty liver. If you get what we call as xanthelasma and xanthomas, which are whitish streaks, which are present very often around the eyes, face and some of the parts of the skin- those indicate high cholesterol, high triglyceride and would almost always be associated with fatty liver. So, if someone has these tell-tale signs, then they must investigate for sugar, cholesterol, heart disease, and fatty liver, adds Dr Shukla.He, however, cautions that absence of any of these does not mean absence of fatty liver disease. And therefore, anybody who has any risk factor for fatty liver like high cholesterol, high sugar, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, or a family history of fatty liver disease or consuming significant alcohol then they should investigate for presence of fatty liver.Dr Miglani shares signs of fatty liver on skin, eyes and faceJaundiceA medical condition known as jaundice causes the skin and eye whites to turn yellow. This happens when the liver is unable to get rid of bilirubin from the blood. When old red blood cells are broken down, bilirubin is created as a waste product. The liver breaks down bilirubin in healthy people and excretes it in the bile. Jaundice, on the other hand, develops when the liver is damaged and unable to handle bilirubin.Spider AngiomasSpider angiomas are small, red spider-like blood vessels that can appear on the face and neck. These are caused by an increase in oestrogen levels, which is common in people with liver disease. The liver is responsible for metabolising hormones, and when it is damaged, it can increase oestrogen levels.Palmar erythemaPalmar erythema is a condition where the palms of the hands turn red. This can be a sign of liver disease, as it is caused by an increase in blood flow to the palms. The exact mechanism behind this is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the build-up of toxins in the liver.Dark circles under the eyesDark circles under the eyes can be a sign of liver disease, as they are often caused by poor liver function. The liver is responsible for filtering toxins from the blood, and when it is unable to do so, it can result in a build-up of toxins in the body. This can lead to dark circles under the eyes and other symptoms such as fatigue and weakness.Acne and other skin conditionsAcne and other skin conditions can be a sign of liver disease, as the liver is responsible for removing toxins from the body. When the liver cannot do so, it can result in a build-up of toxins in the body, leading to skin problems such as acne.This liver disease is considered as a silent disease. It's a great setback because patient does not develop any symptoms and the disease advances gradually. Some people may experience pain or pressure in the middle or right side of their belly, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, loss of appetite and nausea. People with advanced liver disease may show symptoms like spider-like blood vessels, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), itching, fluid accumulation and swelling of the legs (edema), abdomen (ascites) and mental confusion. As there are no symptoms, patients need liver function test (blood test), and ultrasound for diagnosis. Fatty liver can be graded in a better way by Fibroscan, says Dr Punit Singla, Director & HOD - Liver Transplant & HPB Surgery, Marengo Asia Hospitals FaridabadFollow more stories on Facebook & Twitter"

                            "summary": "In India, nearly 2 lakh die of liver disease every year while 10 lakh people are getting diagnosed with liver cirrhosis.The largest internal organ in the human body, liver is not just a digestive organ; it plays a major role in various metabolic processes, complex manufacturing of proteins, hormones, and excretory function.There has been an increase in the prevalence of liver diseases in the last two decades. In India, nearly 2 lakh die of liver disease every year while 10 lakh people are getting diagnosed with liver cirrhosis.Among the population in Kerala, the prevalence of liver diseases is higher with at least 300 patients undergoing expensive treatments like liver transplantation.In the last couple of decades, the rate of metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and hypertension has been increasing. The major reasons are sedentary lifestyle and changes in eating habits. Over eating and alcohol consumption have adversely impacted the liver and digestive health of the people.Why liver diseases are known as silent killers?Whatever be the cause of liver disease, whether alcohol or Nonalcoholic Fatty liver disease (NAFLD), viruses or genetic reasons, the progression happens in a particular manner. Initially fat accumulates (steatosis), followed by inflammation of liver cells (hepatitis) and finally scarring of tissues (fibrosis). Advanced fibrosis results in cirrhosis.The different stages of the progression of the disease, which will occur in 20 to 30 years, to reach the stage of cirrhosis is silent. Usually, the patient doesn’t have any symptoms even when significant changes are happening to the tissues in the liver. The symptoms will surface only when the conditions worsens to the final stage. The silent phase is the golden window of opportunity to treat and recover fully before permanent damage happens in the forms of cirrhosis or liver cancer.The silent phase of liver diseases is the time to get treated and cured. During the symptomatic phase of the disease permanent damage will happen to the liver. The good news is that the liver can completely reverse the condition and regain normal health through timey intervention and treatment. The real challenge is to diagnose the disease at its silent phase. This is where screening is crucial.Screening for liver diseases: When and how?Two decades ago, the average age of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis was 50 or 60. Now, patients in their 40s undergoing liver transplant is not that uncommon. Liver disease screening, after the age of 40 would be an ideal goal, especially for those with risk factors such as regular alcohol consumption, over weight obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension and those with family history of chronic liver disease.Most patients go by a combination of the blood test – LFT and liver ultrasonogram (USG). But this test fails to detect pre-cirrhosis in its silent phase.1. Fibroscan- This is a painless scanning. Fibroscan gives semi-quantitative assessment of scarring fibrosis (which is pre-runner of cirrhosis) as well as quantification of fat in the liver. This assesses liver stiffness by passing ultrasonic waves into liver substance. Fibroscan assesses pre-cirrhosis in its silent phase.2. Ultrasonogram: This gives a rough estimate of fat in the liver. It can detect cirrhosis when it is full-fledged. But silent pre-cirrhosis is rarely detected; hence Ultrasonogram is not an ideal stand-alone screening technique.3. Blood tests: LFT and Platelet count. With progression of scarring fibrosis in the liver, platelet count dips over the years. This is a simple technique of assessing silent cirrhosis. The formulae based on platelet count, viz, APRI, FIB 4 are also used to assess pre-cirrhosis and liver scarring.Economic perspective of liver disease screeningChronic Liver disease, after it reaches the stage of cirrhosis or liver cancer translates into high health care expenditure. Liver transplant and treatment modalities of cancer are quite expensive. If chronic liver disease is detected at its silent phase through screening, restoring normalcy is possible. The expense for screening and the treatment is quite less, mostly involving lifestyle modifications, treatment of liver directed viruses or rarely treatment of genetic disease which causes iron copper over load.In summary, detection of the silent phase of liver diseases through screening techniques not only averts permanent damage to the liver, but also helps reduce overall health care expenses."

Image Credit: MIAStudioShutterstock.comBackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy raises concerns about the potential risk of transmission to the fetus and the adverse uterine environment for the growing fetus.The pressing need for research in this domain was recognized, leading to longitudinal studies on the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and the development of biorepositories.COVID-19 can cause excess complications in pregnancy, such as prematurity, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and a proinflammatory systemic milieu, that may impact lifelong infant health.Growth of infants born from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19A recent study compared longitudinal trajectories of length, weight, and body mass index (BMI) between infants with and without in-utero exposure to SARS-CoV-2.The investigators excluded mothers vaccinated during the study period to decrease heterogeneity. The study found that SARS-CoV-2-exposed infants had lower BMI at birth, even when adjusted for gestational age and relevant covariates than those without exposure.Exposed infants exhibit a rapid increase in BMI during infancyNotably, BMI increased rapidly in exposed infants in the first year of life after accounting for factors influencing BMI.Also, this postnatal increase in BMI was the steepest in those born to those with severe COVID-19. Statistical analyses revealed that low birth weight mediated most effects of COVID-19 on postnatal BMI increase. Although minor changes in length were noticeable, they were not statistically significant.Measuring infant length is challenging and could be more error-prone in clinical and research settings. Therefore, research data collection and larger samples may better appreciate the impact of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on infant growth.A multinational study on neonates with and without in-utero exposure to COVID-19 found that newborns were small. With weight, head circumference, and length being adversely impacted.Previously, the authors of the present study observed that infants born with lower BMI had a rapid postnatal increase and noted that exposure to poverty or tobacco was associated with the postnatal BMI ‘catch-up’. Further, epidemiologic studies report associations between low birth weight and later catch-up with excess cardiometabolic risk during adulthood.However, they do not establish a causal relationship between rapid gain in infant weight and adverse outcomes later in life. Socioeconomic disparities contributing to adverse health throughout the lifecycle may contribute to this pattern. Thus understanding the long-term risks associated with the rapid weight gain of infants exposed to COVID-19 in-utero is yet to be determined.Thus, more research is necessary to understand how long the effects of antenatal COVID-19 persist in life after birth. Additionally, identifying protective factors might result in strategies to enhance preventive care in infants after in-utero SARS-CoV-2 exposure."

                            "summary": "April 15, 2023 08:45 pm | Updated April 17, 2023 09:35 am ISTMuch like many other viruses that have developed strategies to evade T cell-mediated clearance by humans, SARS-CoV-2 virus too has the ability to evade the CD8 T cells. While neutralising antibodies are responsible for preventing infection, CD8 T cells play a huge role in reducing the viral load and clearing the infection by detecting and killing infected cells. The CD8 T cells cannot prevent infection.A study recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus encodes multiple viral factors that modulate major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) expression in the host cells. The MHC I plays an important role in alerting the immune system to virally infected cells. The MHC I molecules are expressed on the surface of all infected cells.MHC I molecules“When a virus infects a cell, one of the ways in which the immune system responds is by attaching short sequences of proteins from the virus (antigen) to MHC I molecules, thus presenting the antigen on the outside of the cell. Killer T-cells look for antigens inside MHC I and if they find any that match the specific thing they are programmed to kill, they go ahead and kill it.” One of the common tricks that viruses use to avoid killing is to inhibit MHC I expression and presentation. SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved multiple strategies to inhibit MHC I expression, which is not seen in the case of the influenza virus. The suppression of MHC I is specifically seen in the infected cells and varies between different viral strains.“Our data showed that MHC I suppression is mediated by a number of viral gene products and affects only the infected cells. Such a mechanism will not lead to generalised immunodeficiency but reflects a specific survival mechanism for SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, Yale University immunologist and the corresponding author of the paper, tweeted.“What does this mean? Immune evasion from CD8 T cells could allow the virus in infected cells to survive better in the host. The virus could establish a safe niche for prolonged replication. To eliminate such persistent reservoirs, we need to employ antivirals or antibody therapy,” she said in another tweet.‘Superior capacity’The ancestral strain first found in Wuhan, China and a few other variants that came up later already had the ability to escape from T cell-mediated immunity by reducing the expression of MHC I. But the authors found that the Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2.12.1, XAF, and BA.4) had a “superior capacity” to suppress MHC I levels on the surface of the cells infected by the virus compared with the ancestral strain and other variants. Besides being endowed with greater ability to evade neutralising antibodies, the Omicron subvariants are better at evading recognition by the killer T cells.Looking for the molecular mechanism of the enhanced MHC I inhibition by Omicron subvariants, the team, led by Dr. Iwasaki, identified common mutations in the E protein (T9I) which are shared among all Omicron subvariants used in the study.“We found that T9I mutation within the E protein significantly enhanced the degree of MHC I downregulation. The results underscore the universal capacity of all SARS-CoV-2 strains to mediate the cell-intrinsic reduction of MHC I expression within the infected cells, and highlight the superior ability of the Omicron subvariants in acquiring MHC I evasion capacity,” they write.Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) showed that MHC I elevation was completely shut down in the infected lung epithelial cells unlike the lung epithelial cells infected with influenza virus. “So, here we found an intrinsically potent ability of SARS-CoV-2 to shut down the host MHC-I system,” Dr. Iwasaki tweeted.Evasion strategy“We demonstrated that the ability to reduce MHC I expression remained unchanged throughout the pre-Omicron variant-of-concern evolution. These findings suggested three important perspectives on the MHC I evasion strategy of SARS-CoV-2,” they write.First, the virus utilises multiple redundant strategies to suppress MHC-I expression. Second, MHC I downregulation may not only impair cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognition of infected cells for killing but may also impair priming of T cells.“Third, given that the variant of concern had not further evolved to down-regulate MHC I more strongly than the original strain except for the Omicron subvariants, the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain was already fully equipped to escape from T cell-mediated immunity with respect to downregulation of MHC-I expression and is under less evolutionary pressure to further optimize the evasion strategy,” they write.“Our study provided evidence of inhibition of MHC I upregulation in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in both in vitro and in vivo settings,” they note.“The cellular mechanisms and consequences of enhanced MHC I inhibition by Omicron variants on infection and disease remain to be determined,” they write."

                            "summary": "Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 after BBIBP-CorV vaccinationTo characterize the humoral response to the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine, we analyzed samples from a cohort of 28 healthy volunteers who received the BBIBP-CorV SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (Supplementary Table 1). Samples were collected over a time course covering before and after immunization to investigate the longitudinal characteristics of the humoral response (Fig. 1a). The plasma IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Consistent with previous reports, prevaccination samples had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins29,30. These antibodies were probably induced by other coronaviruses, particularly seasonally spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins31,32. The levels of circulating spike (S)-, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-, S2- and N protein-specific IgM were increased two weeks after the second dose, and a third vaccine dose did not significantly increase the IgM levels compared with those at the same time points after the second vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The IgG responses to these viral structural proteins were much higher than those of IgM, with strong responses recorded after the two-dose regimen; a booster dose led to a further 2.3–9.4-fold increase in IgG titers against these antigens (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral response in vaccinees. a Schematic diagram of sample collection. Participants (n = 28) received a booster dose of BBIBP-CorV at a median of 9 months after two doses (4 weeks apart). Samples were collected before immunization (Prevaccination, n = 28); at 2 weeks (Dose 1 + 2 W, n = 28) and 1 month (Dose 1 + 1 M, n = 28) after the first dose; at 2 weeks (Dose 2 + 2 W, n = 28), 1 month (Dose 2 + 1 M, n = 28), 3 months (Dose 2 + 3 M, n = 28) and 6 months (Dose 2 + 6 M, n = 27) after the second dose; and at a median of 1 month (Dose 3 + 1 M, n = 19) and 3 months (Dose 3 + 1 M, n = 7) after the third dose (for details, see Supplementary Table 1). b Longitudinal plasma IgG titers to spike (S), receptor-binding-domain (RBD), the S2 region of Spike, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins measured by ELISA. Data are shown as geometric mean titers (GMTs) (values above bars) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 100 for IgG titers. c Comparison of plasma neutralizing antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in samples obtained 2 weeks after the second dose and 1 month and 3 months after the booster dose. Black bars and values above points represent the geometric mean 50% inhibitory dilution (ID 50 ), and the percentages of samples with detectable neutralizing activity above the LLOQ are given in parentheses. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the LLOQ. For values below the LLOQ, LLOD2 values were plotted. The LLOQ of the assay for ID 50 was 10. Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B-cell responses to spike of wild type (WT) (d), Delta (e), and Omicron BA.1 (f) in vaccinated individuals. The numbers above the plots indicate mean values. (Also see Supplementary Fig. 2). Sample size in b–f is presented in (a). Statistical significance was determined using two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test with subsequent Dunn’s multiple comparisons in (b) and (d–f), and two-sided multiple t test with subsequent Holm–Sidak method in (c). Full size imageWe next determined the plasma neutralizing activity using human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Neutralizing activity against wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain) was detectable in all the vaccinees after the two-dose regimen, but it waned over time. A third dose nonetheless significantly boosted the neutralizing titers by more than 14-fold (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The plasma neutralizing activity against WT SARS-CoV-2 was positively correlated with anti-S and anti-RBD-binding IgG titers determined by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants might compromise the efficacy of existing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies33,34,35,36,37,38. We thus assessed the neutralizing activity of the plasma from vaccinated individuals against a panel of 28 pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants (Supplementary Table 2). Consistent with the results for other vaccines, the Omicron variant exhibited substantial immune escape, with only 0–43% of vaccinated individuals having detectable plasma neutralizing activity against its sublineages (Fig. 1c). However, neutralizing titers against the variants were markedly increased after a booster dose of BBIBP-CorV, except for the most antibody-evasive strains, such as BA.2.75.2, BN.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5 (Fig. 1c). Notably, plasma neutralizing activity against Omicron sublineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5) after booster immunization was detectable in more than 81% of the samples, although the percentages declined to 4–58% against the currently prevalent subvariants (BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5) (Fig. 1c).Memory B cells survive in the body for a long time after infection or vaccination, thus remaining ready to quickly recognize and combat any reinfection by pathogens39,40. We used flow cytometry to assess the dynamics of vaccine-mediated circulating memory B cells against the spike proteins from the WT strain and Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants (Supplementary Fig. 2). Generally, the percentages of memory B cells responding to the WT strain and Delta variant were increased after the second dose and further elevated with boosting (Fig. 1d, e). Notably, while the proportion of memory B cells recognizing the Omicron variant was unchanged after the second dose compared to the prevaccination level, it was strongly increased by the third booster immunization (Fig. 1f). This finding likely explains why the plasma neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant was nearly undetectable after the second vaccine dose but substantially increased after a third dose. Overall, we conclude that the humoral immunity elicited by the two-dose regimen may be less effective against pseudoviruses from the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants; nonetheless, the three-dose boosting immunization with the inactivated vaccine that targets the original SARS-CoV-2 strain robustly elicits humoral responses in humans.The inactivated vaccine-induced B-cell responsesTo examine the nature of the antibodies produced by memory B cells in response to the vaccination, we isolated mAbs by focusing on six individuals whose humoral immune responses were robust after the second vaccination (Supplementary Table 3). To determine whether there were changes in the antibodies produced by memory B cells after the booster vaccination, we obtained antibodies after Dose 3 from the same 6 individuals. In parallel, memory B cells of prevaccination samples from three participants in our cohort were sorted, and the V genes, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length and somatic hypermutation (SHM) were characterized by single-cell sequencing, from which paired heavy and light chains of IgG B-cell receptors (BCRs) (n = 403) represented the baseline circulating IgG memory cell repertoire and served as controls.We obtained the heavy and light chains of 118 paired mAbs with binding activity from RBD-specific single B cells in the six individuals, who were sampled 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the second vaccine dose and 1 month after the third dose (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). Sixty-five of the 118 mAbs were isolated after the second vaccination, and 53 mAbs were obtained after the booster dose. Consistent with natural infection, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-53, as well as IGKV1-39 and IGLV3-21, were significantly overrepresented in the RBD-binding memory B-cell compartment of vaccinated individuals (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4). After the third dose, the relative frequency of the IGHV3-9 and IGKV3-15 genes decreased, and unique clones were detected compared to those after the second dose (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, the average CDRH3 length was longer than that in healthy donors (Fig. 2b). The levels of SHM in the VH and VL genes of vaccinated individuals were significantly lower than those in healthy donors, and the mutation percentages increased after Dose 3 compared to those after Dose 2 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, when mAbs from 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months after the second vaccination were stratified, an increase in SHM levels was observed over time for both the VH and VL genes (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). Taken together, there was biased usage of IGHV, IGKV and IGLV genes in the vaccinated individuals, and a booster dose correlated with evolution of the memory B-cell compartment.Fig. 2: Characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated individuals. a The frequency distribution of human IGVH of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs (n = 118) from vaccinees compared to IgG-expressing memory B repertoires (n = 403) of healthy human donors. The mAbs were isolated from PBMCs sampled 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the second vaccine dose (Dose 2) and 1 month after the third dose (Dose 3). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). b The amino acid (aa) length of the CDR3 at IGVH and IGVL in mAbs (n = 118) from vaccinated individuals and in those from prevaccinated healthy donors (n = 403).

The number in the box indicates half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values. The color gradient indicates IC 50 values ranging from 0 (white) to 10,000 ngml. Antibodies with IC 50 values above 10,000 ngml were plotted as 10,000 ngml. Neutralization curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. e Heatmap of the relative inhibition of the binding of the competing mAb (Ab2) to the preformed saturating mAb (Ab1)–RBD complexes (red, competition; light red, partial competition; white, no competition). BLI traces can be found in Supplementary Fig. 6. f Neutralizing activity of mAbs against live SARS-CoV-2 wild type, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 for 10-5B, 6-2C and 13-1C, as well as COV2-2130 and ADG-2. The curves were fitted by nonlinear regression (log [inhibitor] vs. normalized response, variable slope). The dashed line indicates a 50% reduction in viral infectivity. Data for each mAb were obtained from a representative neutralization experiment. Mean ± s.d. of triplicates is shown, except for 13-1C (mean of duplicates). The experiment was replicated twice with similar results. Full size imageSubsequently, we exploited HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses to measure the neutralizing activity of all 118 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Twenty antibodies that presented potent neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 WT strain were used to assess the neutralization spectrum against a panel of 28 SARS-CoV-2 variants (Supplementary Table 4). Eight of the 20 mAbs exhibited neutralizing activity against all the previously circulating VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) and previously circulating VOIs (Lambda, Mu, Kappa, Eta, Iota v1, Iota v2, Epsilon, Zeta), and they were more susceptible to the Beta variant (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, eight mAbs were capable of inhibiting five Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, XD), and four of them retained activity against BA.4 and BA.5. However, the neutralizing activity of these mAbs was further impaired by the new Omicron subvariants with additional RBD mutations, including BA.2.75, BA.2.75.2, BN.1, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5. Overall, one of the 20 mAbs, 6-2C remained active against all the tested SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, we found that mAbs from samples collected after the second dose exhibited a greater loss of neutralizing potency against the pseudotyped variants that carry the E484KA or N501Y mutation, while nearly half of the mAbs isolated after the third dose were more susceptible to variants with the L452RQ mutation (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 5). Thus, neutralizing antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 variants can be induced in individuals immunized with inactivated vaccines despite with compromised potency, and mAbs obtained after the primary two-dose regimen and the booster vaccination differ in their neutralization profile against the variants.To determine the footprints of antibodies elicited by the inactivated vaccine, we analyzed the epitope specificity by 4 structurally defined mAbs, CB6 (Class 1), C121 (Class 2), COV2-2130 (Class 3), and COVA1-16 (Class 4), with biolayer interferometry (BLI)41. The competition profile indicated both overlapping and distinct epitopes recognized by these antibodies (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6). We found that all but one of the seven antibodies isolated after the second dose blocked CB6 (Class 1), while nine of the 13 mAbs obtained after the booster dose did not compete with CB6 (Class 1) (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Additionally, only two antibodies cloned after the second dose inhibited the binding of COV2-2130 (Class 3), while six of 13 mAbs obtained after the third dose competed with the Class 3 antibody (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, the inactivated vaccine could induce a broad spectrum of antibodies with distinct epitopes resembling those following natural infection, and neutralizing antibodies isolated from samples collected after Dose 2 and Dose 3 had differential competition profiles and exhibited bias in epitope specificity. Notably, the broadly neutralizing antibody 6-2C was less competitive and did not compete with the potent antibodies 10-5B and 13-1C, indicating the recognition of distinct epitopes by the antibodies (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, all the evaluated antibodies blocked the binding of the RBD and hACE2 in the BLI assay (Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally, we measured the inhibition of infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 by the nonoverlapping and potent antibodies 6-2C, 10-5B and 13-1C using a cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. Consistent with the data from the respective pseudovirus assay, the 6-2C and 10-5B antibodies were capable of neutralizing live SARS-CoV-2 wild type, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2, especially 10-5B, with IC 50 values below 150 ngml (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 9). 6-2C had moderate IC 50 values ranging from 11 to 1149 ngml. 13-1C was less potent against the Beta variant, although it could inhibit the other four authentic viruses (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 9). The potency of both antibodies was comparable to or greater than that of the approved antibody COV2-2130 as well as that of ADG-2 (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 9).Characterization of bispecific antibodies based on monoclonal antibodiesTo further increase the neutralizing potency and breadth for resistance against viral evasion, one alternative is the use of multispecific antibodies, which have the advantages of both cocktails and single-molecule strategies. In this work, we designed and produced four bsAbs in the IgG-ScFv format based on the nonoverlapping and potent antibodies 6-2C10-5B and 6-2C13-1C (Fig. 2). The bsAbs BI-2C5B and BI-5B2C were the results of the combination of the mAbs 6-2C and 10-5B, with the position of the fragment antigen binding (Fab) of the mAbs exchanged with one another (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the bsAbs BI-2C1C and BI-1C2C were created from mAbs 6-2C and 13-1C (Fig. 3a). Both bsAbs folded correctly, and pure proteins could be obtained, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Supplementary Fig. 10).Fig. 3: Design and characterization of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). a Schematic of four bispecific antibodies in IgG-ScFv format. The parental monoclonal antibodies that form the bispecific antibodies are color-coded: purple, 6-2C; orange, 10-5B; blue, 13-1C. b Binding affinity of bsAbs to RBDs of WT and Omicron BA.4BA.5. Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs were loaded onto the surface of SA biosensors. Individual antibodies were at a series of concentrations. The association and dissociation of response curves of the antibodies are shown. The gray lines represent the fitted curves based on the experimental data. Apparent dissociation constants (K D,app ) are shown above each plot. c, d Competitive binding of parental monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibodies. In c, the immobilized RBD complexed with parental monoclonal antibodies (first antibody) binds to bispecific antibodies (second antibody). In d, RBD–bsAbs prevent binding by their parental monoclonal antibodies. e Neutralization profile of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses for the two bispecific antibodies. The number in the box indicates IC 50 values. The color gradient indicates IC 50 values ranging from 0 (white) to 10,000 ngml. The experiments were performed at least twice. Neutralization curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. f Neutralizing activity of bispecific antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 wild type, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants. Authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was performed using a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. The curves were fitted by nonlinear regression (log [inhibitor] vs. normalized response, variable slope). The dashed line indicates a 50% reduction in viral infectivity. Data for each bsAb were obtained from a representative neutralization experiment. Mean ± s.d. of triplicates (BI-2C5B, BI-5B2C) or mean of duplicates (BI-2C1C, BI-1C2C) is shown. The experiment was replicated twice with similar results. Full size imageThe bsAbs bound with a low nanomolar affinity to the RBD of WT SARS-CoV-2 and to those of circulating variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4BA.5 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 11). The stronger affinity of bsAbs to the Omicron variant compared to that of their parental mAbs may be due to their multivalent binding to the RBD, which results in slower dissociation rates. The bsAbs also bound to the RBD that had already been saturated with either of the parental mAbs, which confirmed that both binding sites were functional (Fig. 3c, d). To assess the neutralizing activity of the bsAbs in vitro, we first determined the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the panel of 28 pseudoviruses (Supplementary Table 2). The bsAbs neutralized WT SARS-CoV-2, previously circulating VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) and previously circulating VOIs (Lambda, Mu, Kappa, Eta, Iota v1, Iota v2, Epsilon, Zeta) at 1–18 ngml (IC 50 ), which was similar to or better than the activity of parental IgGs (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 12). The bsAbs remained effective against Omicron subvariants that bear escape mutations making them resistant to the individual mAbs (Fig. 3e). To confirm the activity of the bsAbs, we performed a cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay with authentic viruses. All the bsAbs efficiently neutralized WT SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 of 2–204 ngml), Beta (IC 50 of 34–220 ngml), Delta (IC 50 of 14–317 ngml), Omicron BA.1 (IC 50 of 3–58 ngml) and Omicron BA.2 (IC 50 of 15–306 ngml) (Fig. 3f). Nevertheless, BI-2C5B and BI-5B2C displayed stronger neutralization potency against the live viruses tested than BI-2C1C and BI-1C2C (Fig. 3f). We conclude that the in vitro binding and neutralization properties of the bsAbs make them preferable over their parental antibodies.Prophylactic activity of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectionTo investigate the relationship between in vitro neutralization and protection in vivo against SARS-CoV-2, we first evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of 10-5B or 6-2C monotherapy or a combination of both 10-5B and 6-2C in a human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model42. The mice were administered a single dose of 20 mgkg 10-5B, 20 mgkg 6-2C, or 10 mgkg 10-5B with 10 mgkg 6-2C one day before the viral challenge (Fig. 4a). The animals treated with PBS served as negative controls. In the challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, the mice treated with either individual antibody gained body weight more rapidly than the control mice during the first week of infection (Fig. 4b). The infectious viral levels in the lungs of antibody-treated animals were undetectable by the focus-forming unit (FFU) assay at 3 days post infection (dpi) (Fig. 4c). In the control group, the infected mice presented perivascular, peribronchial and alveolar inflammation, with the infiltration of immune cells and alveolar damage that are characteristic of viral pneumonia. In contrast, the mice treated with the antibodies showed notably less lung disease (Fig. 4d). Consistent with the histopathology results, the lungs of mice treated with PBS showed intense fluorescence at 3 dpi; however, there was minimal fluorescence in the 10-5B, 6-2C, and their combination-treated animals (Fig. 4e).Fig. 4: Prophylactic activity of antibodies in humanized ACE2 mouse models. a Female 9- to 12-week-old hACE2 transgenic mice were received one dose (20 mgkg body weight) of 10-5B, 6-2C, or their combination (1:1 ratio) 24 h prior to intranasal challenge with 5 × 104 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. b Body weight change was recorded over the course of 7 days (n = 5). Data are shown as the mean ± s.d. of each experimental group. The dark red P value represents a comparison between 10-5B and the control, and the dark yellow P value represents a comparison between 6-2C and the control. c The viral burden from mouse lungs at 3 days post infection (dpi) was determined by a focus-forming unit (FFU) assay (10-5B, n = 5; other groups, n = 4). d Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections from infected mice (3 dpi). Bronchial epithelial cell desquamation (yellow arrow) and lymphocyte infiltration (black arrow) are shown. Scale bars: 100 μm (top); 20 μm (bottom). e Representative immunofluorescence staining of lung sections from infected mice (3 dpi). The nucleocapsid (green) was stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI. Scale bars: 100 μm. f Female 7- to 8-week-old K18-hACE2 mice received one dose (10 mgkg body weight) of bsAb BI-2C5B 24 h prior to intranasal challenge with 3.6 × 103 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant. g Body weight change was recorded (n = 6) as in (b). The purple P value represents a comparison between BI-2C5B and the control. h The viral load from mouse lungs (3 dpi) was measured by RT–qPCR assay (n = 6). i, j Representative H&E and immunofluorescence staining of lung sections (3 dpi) from infected K18-hACE2 mice, as in (d) and (e), respectively. P values were determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test in (b), two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test with subsequent Dunn’s multiple comparisons in (c), two-sided multiple t test with subsequent Holm–Sidak method in (g), and two-tailed Mann–Whitney U tests in (h). The dashed line indicates the assay limit of detection, and the mean ± s.e.m. of all data points are shown in (c, h). Full size imageWe also tested the bsAb BI-2C5B for prophylactic efficacy in a K18-hACE2 mouse model43. The mice received a single dose of 10 mgkg BI-2C5B one day before intranasal challenge with a 3.6 × 103 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant (Fig. 4f). Passive transfer of BI-2C5B decreased Omicron BA.2-induced weight loss in the mice during the first week of infection compared to mice in the control group treated with PBS (Fig. 4g). Viral RNA levels in the lungs of the mice treated with BI-2C5B were reduced significantly at 3 dpi (Fig. 4h). Antibody-treated mice exhibited fewer lung lesions as well as reduced fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4i, j). Overall, these results indicated that 10-5B, 6-2C, and their combinations can effectively protect hACE2 transgenic mice against infectious SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron BA.2 variants, suggesting their prophylactic potential for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.Structural basis of antibody binding and neutralizationTo define the molecular basis of mAb binding and neutralization and to understand how the activity of bsAbs might be increased, we investigated the mAbs 6-2C and 10-5B and bsAb BI-2C5B for structural characterization by X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures included a crystal structure of WT-RBD bound with 6-2C Fab (2.2 Å) and cryo-EM structures of WT spike bound with 10-5B Fab (3.3 Å), BA.1 spike bound with 10-5B and 6-2C Fabs (3.2 Å), and BA.4 spike bound with 10-5B and 6-2C (2.9 Å) Fabs (Supplementary Figs. 13–16, 17a and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). We further performed local refinement to improve the densities around the antibodyRBD interfaces in the cryo-EM structures (Supplementary Fig. 16). Structural alignments showed that 6-2C or 10-5B had nearly identical binding modes to WT, BA.1 and BA.4 spike proteins (Supplementary Fig. 17b). Therefore, we utilized the cryo-EM structure of the BA.1 spike bound with 6-2C and 10-5B Fab to illustrate the overall features of antibody recognition. The 3D classification showed a major conformation of the BA.1 S trimer with three RBDs adopting the “up” conformation, each bound by one 6-2C Fab and one 10-5B Fab (Fig. 5a). The neutralizing epitope on the RBD has been grouped into four Classes (Class 1–Clas 4) or seven “communities” (RBD-1 to RBD-7)41,44. 6-2C binds to the core with an uncommon epitope between RBD-5 and RBD-7 (Class 3), consisting of residues N343, A344, T345, L371, P373, F374, F375, W436, N437, S438, N439, K440, L441, S443, K444, V445, P499, T500, V503, Q506, Y508, and N343-linked glycans, which has slight overlap with the ACE2-binding site (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 17c). 10-5B binds to the residues Y449, L455, F456, N477, V483, A484, G485, F486, N487, C488, Y489, and R493 on the receptor-binding motif (RBM). This epitope belongs to the RBD-2 community (Class 1) and has extensive overlap with the ACE2-binding site on the RBM (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 17c).Fig. 5: Structural characterization of the mAbs 6-2C and 10-5B. a Cryo-EM structure viewed along two orthogonal orientations of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 S trimer (yellow) bound with 10-5B Fab (salmon) and 6-2C Fab (purple).

H bonds are marked by dotted lines. f H bonds and salt bridges of 10-5B formed with RBD (WT, BA.1, and BA.4) residues 477, 484, and 486. Full size imageNotably, 6-2C broadly neutralized all the tested variants, including the most antibody-evasive variants XBB.1.5, XBB, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75.2. In general, core-RBD epitopes tend to be mutationally constrained with respect to folding and expression and are mostly conserved across sarbecoviruses, explaining the possible neutralization breadth of antibody 6-2C45. Nevertheless, its potency against the tested Omicron subvariants was reduced by 10- to 189-fold compared to its potency against WT SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2d). The interface of 6-2C with WT RBD was well defined in the 2.2 Å crystal structure, and densities around its interfaces with BA.1 and BA.4 RBDs in the cryo-EM structures were also greatly improved by local refinement for model building of the side chains of most interacting residues. PISA was used to calculate the interface areas, contacts, and hydrogen bonds at the interfaces of 6-2C with WT, BA.1 and BA.4 RBDs, respectively. The number of contacts at the 6-2CWT RBD and 6-2CBA.4 RBD was nearly the same (145 vs. 141) and increased slightly to 167 at the 6-2CBA.1 RBD-interface (Fig. 5d). The number of hydrogen bonds was reduced from 16 for WT RBD to 9 for BA.1 RBD and slightly to 13 for BA.4 RBD (Fig. 5d). Structural analysis showed that the disruption of hydrogen bonds was mainly due to the S371LF, S373P, and S375F mutations found in all Omicron subvariants, resulting in a main-chain conformational change of the hairpin loop (residues Y369–C379) harboring these three mutations. For example, 5 hydrogen bonds from WT-RBD S371, A373 and S373 to 6-2C were all disrupted at the 6-2CBA.1-RBD interface due to conformational change. Only 2 hydrogen bonds formed between BA.4-RBD F371 and 6-2C (Fig. 5e). The distinct loops of BA.1 (aa371–aa377, LAPFFTF) and BA.4 (aa371–aa377, FAPFFAF) and the resulting side-chain conformational differences led to the different contacts for antibody 6-2C with the spike of BA.1 and BA.4. (Supplementary Fig. 18). These observations together explained the relatively decreased binding activity of 6-2C against the Omicron variant. Furthermore, the epitope of 6-2C overlapped or clashed with the ACE2-binding site on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, indicating competition with ACE2, as supported by the BLI assay (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 19), suggesting that 6-2C neutralized SARS-CoV-2 through the inhibition of virushost cell interactions.We have shown that 10-5B is highly potent against the pseudoviruses of WT SARS-CoV-2 and nearly all tested VOCs and VOIs, including Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.3 and XD subvariants, with IC 50 values in the range of 2–46 ngml (Fig. 2d). However, its potency was significantly decreased to more than 10,000 ngml against Omicron BA.45 and its subvariants (Fig. 2d). Similar to the analysis of the 6-2CRBD interfaces, we used PISA to calculate the interface areas, contacts, and hydrogen bonds at the interfaces of 10-5B with WT, BA.1 and BA.4 RBDs, respectively (Fig. 5d). Although the interface density map of 10-5B was not as good as that of 6-2C in the locations of the side chains of interacting residues, the PISA analysis still provided rational information for investigating the structural basis of the binding and neutralization of 10-5B against Omicron subvariants. It was found that there were ~86 contacts and ~10 hydrogen bonds at the 10-5BWT-RBD interface (Fig. 5d). At the 10-5BBA.1-RBD interface, the number of contacts was ~84, but the number of hydrogen bonds was decreased to ~6. The 10-5BBA.4-RBD interface showed more significant reductions: the number of contacts was decreased to ~65 and the number of hydrogen bonds was only ~1 (Fig. 5d). Structural analysis further revealed that most hydrogen bonds formed between the WT-RBD E484–Y489 region and 10-5B. The S477N and E484A mutations in BA.1 and BA.4 affected the formation of hydrogen bonds of these two RBD sites with 10-5B (Fig. 5f). The additional mutation F486V found in BA.4 further disrupted more hydrogen bonds by changing the local structure and breaking the hydrogen bond network around the E484–Y489 region. These findings explained the relative reduction in the binding affinity of 10-5B with BA.1 RBD, and the strikingly decreased binding with BA.4 RBD. The footprint of 10-5B largely overlapped with the site of ACE2 in the RBM, resulting in competition with ACE2 binding to the RBD via steric hindrance, providing the structural basis for its neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 WT and Omicron BA.1 (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 19)."

                            "summary": "In a recent study posted to the bioRxiv* preprint server, researchers perform extensive multiscale investigations to explore virological characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron XBB subvariant, XBB.1.16.Study: Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.16 variant. Image Credit: Limbitech  Shutterstock.com*Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practicehealth-related behavior, or treated as established information.BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.16 variant is associated with a 1.27- and 1.17-fold higher effective reproductive number (R e ) as compared to the XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 subvariants, respectively, thus indicating the ability of this novel Omicron variant to disseminate quickly.As a result of this increased transmissibility, the World Health Organization (WHO) began monitoring XBB.1.16 on March 30, 2023, following its detection in several countries, including India. Earlier, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants with the F486P substitution in their spike (S) protein, which include XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.9, were widely circulating worldwide.Study findingsThe current analyses showed that as compared to its predecessor mutant strains, XBB.1.16 had two S substitutions, including E180V and T478R in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Furthermore, the dissociation constant (K D ) of the XBB.1.16 RBD for the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was 2.4-fold higher than XBB.1.5; however, its K D values were markedly poorer than that of XBB.1, thus reflecting the binding affinities of this novel subvariant.Pseudovirus assays showed that the infectivity of XBB.1.16 was comparable to that of XBB.1 but unlike XBB.1.5, the latter of which had higher infectivity than the parental XBB.1 mutant. Note that the S: T478R and S: E180V substitution mutations have a significant influence on the infectivity of this viral variant. Whereas the S: T478R mutation increases the infectivity of XBB.1.16, the S: E180V substitution significantly reduced its viral infectivity.XBB.1.16 likely acquired these two S protein mutations simultaneously as a strategy to evolve. This behavior has been previously observed in other Omicron subvariants, including BA.5 and XBB.1. Indeed, XBB.1.16 follows the evolutionary path of Omicron subvariants that emerged earlier.Regarding sensitivity to sera, neutralization assays showed that XBB.1.16 was highly resistant to sera from individuals reinfected with Omicron BA.2BA.5, 18- and 37-fold more resistant than Omicron B.1.1B.1.1. However, the sensitivity of this variant to convalescent sera of hamsters infected with XBB.1 was similar to XBB.1XBB.1.5 mutants.XBB.1.16 was highly resistant to all six clinically available monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Only sotrovimab exhibited antiviral activity against XBB.1.16; however, this effect was weak. Lastly, antigenic cartography showed that XBB.1.16 had antigenicity close to XBB.1; however, this characteristic differed considerably from that associated with XBB.1.5.ConclusionsOverall, the current extensive exploratory analyses uncovered that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.16 subvariant has immense potential to disseminate and infect people worldwide to a greater extent than XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 subvariants. Furthermore, XBB.1.16 exhibits a higher immune-evasion potential that is similar to that of XBB.1 and XBB.1.5.The authors reasoned that XBB.1.16 enjoyed a higher fitness and growth advantage due to different antigenicity than XBB.1.5. Moreover, mutations in the non-S SARS-CoV-2 proteins also potentially contributed to its higher fitness.*Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practicehealth-related behavior, or treated as established information."

In most cases, it is curable if detected early.Having one or two symptoms of bowel cancer does not always mean that you have cancer.The five most common symptoms of bowel cancer, which are important to look out for, are:Bleeding from the back passage , which is the most important and common symptom of bowel cancer. Bleeding per rectum can be caused by benign diseases, but always best to seek advice and rule out a serious underlying cause., which is the most important and common symptom of bowel cancer. Bleeding per rectum can be caused by benign diseases, but always best to seek advice and rule out a serious underlying cause. Persistent and unexplained change in bowel habits , such as having diarrhoea or constipation., such as having diarrhoea or constipation. Unexplained weight lossUnexplained tiredness , due to anaemia arising from blood loss, due to anaemia arising from blood loss Having a lump in the abdomen or the back passage, is hard to identify unless you have a flat tummy alongside advanced bowel cancer, this is not very common. However, the most identified lump associated with bowel or anal cancer is a painful lump in the anus.Mr Owais said: If a patient ever experiences one or more of the above symptoms, they must not delay reporting it to their GP.Most of these symptoms can be vague and can have other explanations for them. Noticing any of these symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean that you have bowel cancer.He added: We receive hundreds of referrals every week for patients who have the above symptoms.Reassuringly only a small percentage of these patients go on to receive a bowel cancer diagnosis. But every single referral was warranted and every investigation was essential, it is never a waste of my time.Mr Owais emphasised by saying: The earlier we diagnose bowel cancer the more likely patients are to survive it. Thankfully bowel cancer is a treatable and curable condition when detected early.The main purpose of this campaign is to spread awareness of bowel cancer and to reinforce that early detection and intervention can save lives. We support all patients with bowel cancer, but it is important that we get to treat the patient early."

Then 21, she ended up quitting the job because it didn't allow her to spontaneously leave the court to use the bathroom.But after many tests at the emergency room, doctors told Rennison it was just irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, she told the charity Guts UK.A few years later, Rennison's symptoms worsened. I became scared of eating in case it triggered symptoms, she told the London-based charity. By 2020, she'd developed diarrhea-induced agoraphobia, or a fear of leaving the house and being unable to use the bathroom.At her condition's worst, Rennison said, she used the toilet as many as 40 times a day. I felt more tired than I'd ever felt in my life and completely hopeless, the finance worker and mom in South London said.Rennison was diagnosed after getting a biopsy of her colonFinally, in August 2022, Rennison booked an appointment with a gastroenterologist. While she'd seen doctors and undergone colonoscopies before, this time she asked for a biopsy of her colon too.The tests revealed that she had microscopic colitis (MC), or an inflamed large intestine that causes persistent watery diarrhea, per the Mayo Clinic. Unlike other inflammatory bowel diseases, like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the condition is typically only diagnosable via biopsy, where a colon tissue sample is examined under a microscope.Rennison was specifically diagnosed with lymphocytic colitis, a subtype of MC in which white blood cells increase in colon tissue.Though relieved to have an answer, Rennison said she was angered by how differently she was treated when people thought she just had IBS.I'd been gaslighted for years and made to feel that because my illness wasn't clinically worse, the severity and frequency of my symptoms and the impact on my quality of life didn't matter, she said.Microscopic colitis is common, but forgotten by the publicMC is relatively common, affecting between and 1 and 25 per 100,000 people in the US each year, various estimates show.Tamara Duker Freuman, a dietitian who specializes in gastroenterology, told Insider that American doctors frequently conduct biopsies during colonoscopies specifically to rule out MC in patients with abnormal stools.Still, awareness lags in the general population, Rennison believes, compared to more well-known types of inflammatory bowl disease like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It feels like the forgotten Inflammatory Bowel Disease, she said.The main symptom is watery diarrhea, though patients can also experience abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and fecal incontinence, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.MC is most often diagnosed in women in their 60s, and smoking and certain medications can raise the risk, the site says.Duker Freuman, author of Regular: The Ultimate Guide to Taming Unruly Bowels and Achieving Inner Peace, said the condition is usually treated with rectal steroids or anti-inflammatories.The Mayo Clinic recommends a low-fat, low-fiber diet, as well as cutting out dairy and gluten, too.Unlike Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, MC doesn't seem to raise the risk of colon cancer, the Mayo Clinic says. Still, as Rennison experienced, it can greatly affect quality of life. After two bouts of steroids, she said, she's grateful to have resumed some semblance of normal."

                            "summary": "Up to one in 20 new diabetes cases could be related to Covid infection, data suggests.The research adds to mounting evidence the pandemic may be contributing to a rapidly escalating diabetes crisis, with individuals who have experienced more severe Covid at greatest risk.However, lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese continue to be the main driver for the increase, with 4.3 million officially diagnosed cases in the UK alone.Although previous research has hinted that Sars-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of developing diabetes – possibly by damaging insulin-producing cells in the pancreas – these studies were either relatively small or limited to specific groups of individuals, such as US military veterans, who may not represent the general population.To delve deeper, Prof Naveed Janjua at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and his colleagues turned to the British Columbia Covid-19 Cohort, a surveillance platform that links data on Covid infections and vaccinations with sociodemographic and administrative health data.They examined records from 629,935 people who took a PCR test for Covid and found those who tested positive were significantly more likely to experience a new diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the following weeks and months – with 3-5% of new diabetes cases attributable to Covid overall.“Another way to phrase this is out of 100 people with diabetes, 3-5% are related to Sars-CoV-2 infection,” said Janjua, whose research was published in the JAMA Network Open medical journal.Men and women who were hospitalised with Covid appeared to be at greatest risk. However, among the general population, the association between Sars-CoV-2 infection and diabetes risk was significant only for men – possibly due to sex-specific immune responses to the virus.“Given the large number of people infected with Covid-19, these excess diabetes cases could translate into very large population level burden of diabetes which could strain already stretched healthcare systems,” Janjuar said.“This highlights the importance of healthcare organisations and medical professionals being mindful of the possible long-term outcomes of Covid-19. It may be important to monitor individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 for diabetes, especially those who had more severe disease during the acute phase of infection, as early detection and treatment can be critical in managing diabetes. In addition, diet and physical activity may help in controlling diabetes risk.”Dr Caroline Ponmani, a consultant in paediatric emergency medicine at Queen’s hospital in Romford, Essex, who has been investigating links between Covid and the development of type 1 diabetes in children, said: “This is new and highly interesting data which has long-term implications in resource planning and allocation. It has a longer follow-up time compared to other studies, and it appears that the incidence of new onset diabetes continues to be high after Sars-CoV-2 infection.”Although individuals in this study were predominantly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which is more common in adults, Ponmani’s research suggests Covid infection is more likely to be associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in children.During the first year of the pandemic she identified a 17% increase in new onset diabetes cases among children across the UK and Ireland, compared with a background incidence of 3-5% over the past 10 years. More than 95% of these children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.The latest data from the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit for England and Wales also reports that 2021 and 2022 have been high incidence years for new onset type 1 diabetes in children, Ponmani said.Even so, further research is needed to confirm that the virus is the direct cause of people’s diabetes. Another possibility is that more cases are being picked up as a result of screening when people with Covid are admitted to hospital, or that some of these cases are transient and may resolve over time. “What we need to find out is longer term, is this true diabetes?” said Kamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester.Assuming the virus is directly to blame, the underlying mechanism also still needs to be teased out.“Some studies have suggested that Sars-CoV-2 could infect cells that produce insulin in pancreas, leading to alteration of their function and insulin production, while other studies are not conclusive on this theory,” said Janjua. “It is also suggested that chronic low-grade inflammation common in people with obesity, a problem with the autonomic nervous system, hyperactivated immune response or autoimmunity, could also play a role in diabetes.”"

Individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were matched on sex, age, and collection date of test to those who tested negative in a 1:4 ratio (125,987 and 503,948 individuals, respectively).The researchers found that events of incident diabetes occurred among 0.5 and 0.4 percent of those who were exposed and not exposed, respectively, during the median follow-up of 257 days. The exposed versus the nonexposed group had a significantly higher incident diabetes rate per 100,000 person-years (672.2 versus 508.7 incidents). The exposed group also had a higher risk for incident diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.17) as did men (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22). A higher risk for diabetes was seen among those with severe disease, including those admitted to the intensive care unit or hospital (hazard ratios, 3.29 and 2.42, respectively). The fraction of incident diabetes cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 3.41 and 4.75 percent overall and among men.Our study highlights the importance of health agencies and clinicians being aware of the potential long-term consequences of COVID-19 and monitoring people after COVID-19 infection for new-onset diabetes for timely diagnosis and treatment, the authors write.One author disclosed financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.AbstractFull Text"

                            "summary": "CALIFORNIA: UC Davis researchers are the first to describe how oligodendrocyte-lineage cells transfer cell material to neurons in the mouse brain. Their findings show that these cells and neurons interact in a coordinated nuclear manner.The findings of the study were published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.This novel concept of material transfer to neurons opens new possibilities for understanding brain maturation and finding treatments for neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, said corresponding author Olga Chechneva . Chechneva is an assistant project scientist at UC Davis Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and independent principal investigator in the Institute for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine at Shriners Children's Northern California.What are oligodendrocyte-lineage cells?Oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, also called oligodendroglia, are a type of glial cells found in the central nervous system. From birth onward, these glial cells arise to support neural circuit maturation. They are mostly known for their role in myelination - the formation of the insulating myelin sheath around nerve axons.Satellite oligodendrocytes are a distinct type of oligodendroglia found in close contact with neuronal bodies in the gray matter of the central nervous system. They are involved in several functions, including supporting the survival of nearby neurons, regulating neurotransmitter release, and modulating synaptic activity. They have a different form and structure than the classic oligodendrocytes that produce myelin in the white matter.Research has mostly focused on studying the myelinating function of oligodendrocytes, while satellite oligodendrocytes and their interaction with neurons are not well understood, Chechneva said.Unexpected observation makes a new discovery possibleCapturing the glia-neuron interaction started with an unexpected observation. The researchers were using special fluorescent proteins to label and track oligodendroglia in the mouse brain and spinal cord. They were surprised to find that ribosomal and nuclear reporter proteins were not only present in these cells, but also inside neurons of the mouse model.When something unexpected like this happens, we need to make sure it's not an artifact, Chechneva said. It was puzzling why these proteins, which should only be in oligodendroglia, are also in neurons. Our team used different controls and did multiple experiments to conclude that oligodendrocytes transfer nuclear and ribosomal material to neurons.Open borders for material transferMaterial transfer of proteins and molecules from neuron to neuron and glia cells to neurons is critical to neuronal survival, function and recovery after injury.Until now, there were two known ways of material transfer in the neural system. The first is tunneling nanotubes or gap junctions, which are channels that allow for direct communication between cells. The other mechanism is through the release of extracellular vesicles (small structures that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids). These vesicles can transfer various molecules that can be taken up by neighboring cells.This study is the first to capture and report on satellite oligodendrocytes found in contact with neurons that received material and with the plasma membrane between them interrupted.We are looking at the possibility of an additional new mechanism where the cell can directly transfer material to another cell, in particular satellite oligodendrocyte to neuron. We could clearly see that cell nuclei from both cells come together, and the plasma membrane (the physical border between cells) was open, Chechneva explained.Exploring the transfer mechanism for potential therapies to neurodegenerative diseasesThe study showed that oligodendroglia-neuron material transfer establishes after birth, during a critical period of brain maturation.The fact that this transfer process is established during postnatal development is very interesting. These are critical periods when the brain is maturing and brain circuits are formed, Chechneva said.The team still doesn't know the regulatory mechanism of material transfer or its duration.Our knowledge about this mechanism is extremely new, and it opens many questions for understanding how neurons work and its biological relevance in many neurological disorders. This is very exciting, Chechneva added."

Scientists call this process “adult hippocampus neurogenesis (AHN).” In people with Alzheimer’s disease, this process is impaired, leading to reduced production of ABNs with poorer qualities. Given that Alzheimer’s patients often develop both cognitive symptoms (such as memory loss) and non-cognitive symptoms (such as anxiety and depression) for which AHN plays a critical role, one way to help Alzheimer’s patients achieve symptom relief could be to restore AHN.Published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, scientists from University in Chapel Hill School of Medicine, US, demonstrated that stimulating a brain region called Supramammilary nucleus (SuM) located in the hypothalamus effectively enhanced adult-born neurons in the otherwise impaired Alzheimer’s brains of mice. After patterned stimulation of SuM, Alzheimer’s brains developed more ABNs with improved qualities. Importantly, activation of these SuM-modified ABNs restored both cognitive and affective deficits in Alzheimer’s mouse models.“It has been a longstanding question whether AHN can be sufficiently enhanced in impaired Alzheimer’s brains to improve brain function,” said senior author Dr Juan Song. “An important point to consider when addressing these questions is the low-level hippocampal neurogenesis, which becomes even lower in Alzheimer’s patients.By manipulating a small number of ABNs in the Alzheimer’s brain, we demonstrate that ABNs can be enhanced even in the presence of Alzheimer’s pathology, and these enhanced ABNs are important for the restoration of behaviours and hippocampal function.”To enhance ABNs in Alzheimer’s brains, Song and colleagues adopted an elegant two-step ABN-enhancing strategy by first stimulating SuM using a patterned optogenetic paradigm with the goal of promoting the generation and developmental properties of ABNs, followed by stimulating the activity of SuM-enhanced ABNs using chemogenetics.Optogenetics involves the use of light to alter the activity of brain cells expressing light-sensitive opsin genes. Chemogenetics involves the use of inert molecules to alter the activity of brain cells expressing designer’s receptors.“Interestingly, SuM stimulation alone or activation of ABNs without SuM stimulation failed to restore behavioural deficits in Alzheimer’s mice.” Song said. “These results suggest that multi-level enhancement of ABNs — namely increasing their number, improving their developmental properties, and enhancing their activity — is required to achieve their therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer’s brains.”When Song and colleagues further analysed the protein changes in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s mice in response to activation of SuM-enhanced ABNs, the researchers found that several well-known protein pathways were activated inside cells. These pathways include the ones important for synaptic plasticity of neuronal cells that allow enhanced communication among them, as well as the ones important for phagocytosis of non-neuronal microglia that allow efficient plaque clearance.“It is striking that multi-level enhancement of ABNs through combined SuM and ABN stimulations allows such a small number of ABNs make profound functional contribution in diseased Alzheimer’s brains,” Song said. “We are eager to find out the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects mediated by activation of SuM-enhanced ABNs on Alzheimer’s pathology and hippocampal function. Future efforts will be needed to develop drugs that mimic these beneficial effects mediated by activation of SuM-enhanced ABNs. Ultimately, the hope is to develop first-in-class, highly targeted therapies to treat Alzheimer’s and related dementia.”"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:The researchers observed how motor proteins moved along a microtubule using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, pictured here, where researchers observe individual, fluorescently labeled proteins and DNA molecules using high-powered cameras and lenses. Credit: Jeff XuPenn StateNeurons, which are responsible for producing the signals that ultimately trigger an action such as talking or moving a muscle, are built and maintained by classes of motor proteins that transport molecular cargo along elongated tracks called microtubules. A Penn State-led team of researchers uncovered how two main groups of motor proteins compete to transport cargo in opposite directions between the cell body and the synapse in neurons.Through single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and computational modeling, the group investigated how three classes of one type of motor protein, known as kinesins, engage with another type of motor, dynein, during cargo transport. Their discoveries, published in eLife, can help scientists better understand the normal cargo transport process, and, in future work, inform how it is disrupted in the case of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's.Kinesin and dynein move along microtubules, which are over 1,000 times smaller than a piece of hair, said corresponding author William Hancock, Penn State professor of biomedical engineering (BME). Because of the microtubules' structural polarity, kinesin motors bind to a cargo and pull it in one direction, carrying it toward the synapse, while dyneins bind and move in the opposite direction, back to the cell body of the neuron. When both motors bind to a cargo load at the same time, a competition between the two motors ensues, and how each performs determines how fast and in what direction the cargo will travel.There are about a dozen different types of transport kinesins broken up into three families, while there is just one type of transport dynein. The researchers took a single kinesin motor from each of the three families and linked it to dynein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy—where scientists observe individual, fluorescently labeled proteins and DNA molecules using high-powered cameras and lenses—they observed how the proteins moved along the microtubule.Each kinesin motor is like a different type of car on the road: One is a racecar, one is a SUV, one is a truck, Hancock said. Some kinesin motors move short distances, some move long distances, some move faster and some move slower. Because the motors perform so differently from one another in isolation, we were surprised by what we found when we hooked them together with dynein.Despite their apparent differences, researchers found that all three kinesin types performed equivalently against dynein: They all withstood dynein's hindering loads effectively.To better understand the underlying mechanism, the researchers took their experimental results and developed a computational model, which indicated that the three kinesin types use different approaches for competing against dynein.Kinesin-1 motors pull steadily against dynein, detaching relatively rarely from the microtubule track, but take some time to attach back. Kinesin-3 motors detach easily when pulling against dynein, but attach back to the microtubule track quickly, taking as little as a millisecond to start moving again. Kinesin-2 motors demonstrate a combination of the behaviors of kinesin-1 and -3.The experimental results indicate that the mechanical properties of kinesin are not what determine the direction and speed of the cargo transport; something else is at play.The finding that kinesin-3 motors reattach to their track within a millisecond is striking, and we want to both confirm and understand the biophysical mechanisms underlying this fast reattachment, Hancock said. We also plan to look at the regulation of the adapter molecules that connect the protein motors to their cargo, as well the mechanical stiffness of the cargo, to see if those factors play a role.To do this, researchers will put the motors under different mechanical loads by connecting them to proteins with longer and longer pieces of DNA, while analyzing their movements under the microscope.Understanding the intracellular transport system, as well as its vulnerability to mutations, can help scientists make advancements in the study of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.It is clear that defects in intracellular transport are important aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms and how the transport defects contribute to the pathology are not clear, Hancock said. With these new insights into the motor mechanisms of kinesin, we hope to interpret how mutations affect its transport ability and thereby compromise neuronal health.More information: Allison M Gicking et al, Kinesin-1, -2, and -3 motors use family-specific mechanochemical strategies to effectively compete with dynein during bidirectional transport, eLife (2022).

                            "summary": "In a recent study, researchers have discovered that the movement of neurons is caused by the push and pull of motor proteins. These proteins, which are responsible for transporting various molecules and structures within cells, were found to play a crucial role in the displacement of neurons.A Penn State-led team of researchers has discovered how motor proteins compete to transport molecular cargo between the cell body and the synapse in neurons. The study, which used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and computational modeling, focused on how kinesins interact with the motor protein dynein during cargo transport. The findings, published in eLife, provide insights into the normal cargo transport process and could inform future research on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.Neurons require robust, long-distance, bidirectional cargo transport by kinesin and dynein motors to function. Disrupted transport in neurons is linked to neurogenerative diseases. The tug-of-war model is not sufficient to account for the range of bidirectional transport activities in cells.Cellular and in vitro studies of bidirectional transport have provided important information about the specific isotypes and numbers of motors present on cargo during transport, as well as characterizing cargo dynamics and the codependence of opposite directionality motors.An elegant method that fuses single-stranded DNA to each motor links them together through complementary DNA base pairing and tracks the motor pairs by two-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has been developed to directly track kinesin and dynein motor pairs in vitro.The study involved observing the behavior of motor proteins within neurons using advanced imaging techniques. The researchers found that these proteins work in a coordinated manner to generate the forces necessary to move neurons in different directions. This movement is crucial for a variety of neuronal processes, including the formation of synapses and the growth of axons and dendrites.“Kinesin and dynein move along microtubules, which are over 1,000 times smaller than a piece of hair,” said corresponding author William Hancock, Penn State professor of biomedical engineering (BME).“Because of the microtubules’ structural polarity, kinesin motors bind to a cargo and pull it in one direction, carrying it toward the synapse, while dyneins bind and move in the opposite direction, back to the cell body of the neuron.

They found that different types of kinesin motors generate enough force to compete against dynein, which was unexpected. They used a computer model to simulate the movement and found that fast reattachment of kinesin motors compensates for their tendency to detach under load, making them robust transport motors.Overall, this study provides important insights into the fundamental mechanisms that underlie neuronal movement and highlights the critical role that motor proteins play in this process.Journal Reference:"

                            "summary": "The GI value of food helps determine its impact on one's blood sugar levelsThe glycemic index is an indicator which helps people with diabetes plan their meals. As you know, it is crucial for diabetics to maintain healthy blood sugar levels to prevent the complications associated with uncontrolled diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial to consume foods that can help naturally maintain healthy blood sugar levels and avoid foods which can cause a spike. But how can one determine the impact of food consumed on their blood sugar levels? That's exactly where the glycemic index helps. Glycemic Index (GI) is a tool which helps in better blood sugar management. The GI value of food helps determine its impact on one's blood sugar levels. Foods are classified as low, medium and high glycemic foods. A food item with low GI will have less impact on your blood sugar levels. On the other hand, high GI foods will impact your blood sugar levels and should be avoided if you have diabetes.Rice is one such food which can have a medium to high GI depending upon the cooking time and type of rice you are using. Rice is a common grain which many eat daily and is hard to avoid. But do you know you can lower down the GI of rice with a simple hack? Let's find out how.Diabetes: This is how you can reduce the GI of cooked riceCelebrity nutritionist Pooja Makhija shared an Instagram reel and explained the hack that can help lower the GI of cooked rice.One day old cooked refrigerated, stale rice is better than piping hot freshly cooked rice, she said at the beginning of the video.Later she added that several clinical studies have proven that cooling cooked starch causes a process known as starch retrogradation which converts it into resistant starch.In simple words, when you cool high starch foods such as cooked rice or potato, you convert the digestible starch into resistant starch. Digestible starch is the one your body breaks down and your blood sugar level rises. Resistant starch is the one that your body cannot break down and it is not bad for you. It is actually what is known as prebiotic that feeds the gut flora, Makhija said in the video.So, it can be concluded that rice cooked a day before is good for your blood sugar levels as well as improves your gut health.How long should you refrigerate?Makhija added that cooked rice kept in the refrigerator for 24 hours and then reheated and eaten has a far lower GI than freshly cooked piping hot rice.This is a very simple hack that diabetics and women with PCOS can try, she concluded.Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Memory T cells , which are critical for a vaccine that induces a powerful immune response, can be recruited into the liver of a Salmonella mouse model, according to new research from the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Understanding the immunology is key to developing a better vaccine, said Professor Stephen McSorley , Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Cell Biology and senior author on the paper.McSorley's laboratory studies Salmonella, and other bacterial infections such as Chlamydia, in laboratory mice. It's recently become clear that a type of immune cell called tissue resident memory cells are key to immunity to Salmonella in mice, he said.When a pathogen enters the body, the immune system mounts a response, including CD4 T-cells which support other responses, such as antibody production by B-cells. When the infection is over, some of the cells specific to that pathogen remain as memory cells, waiting to be called rapidly into service again if the same threat returns.In the mouse model of Salmonella infection, those CD4 memory T-cells don't circulate around the body. They hunker down in the liver as tissue resident memory cells.We want to know, how do these cells get generated? said Claire Depew, graduate student in McSorley's laboratory and first author on the paper. The researchers knew that another type of tissue resident memory cell, CD8 cells, require a signal from the tissue to take up residence. Was the same true for the CD4?To study the problem, Depew adapted an approach used by Australian researchers to study malaria, another disease involving tissue resident memory cells in the liver. She took CD4 T-cells specific for Salmonella and transferred them into mice that had never been infected with Salmonella, so the researchers could study which factors would cause those T-cells to become resident memory cells in the liver.They found that molecules that promote inflammation, especially interleukin-1 and 2, enhanced formation of Salmonella-specific CD4 tissue resident memory cells in the mice. This provides a rapid-response force that can act quickly against Salmonella infection. They're trained and ready to go, McSorley said.The basic science results will help researchers in designing new vaccines for Salmonella, McSorley said. A successful vaccine would need to promote conditions to form these cells, without causing liver inflammation, he said."

Markram first caught Ishan, who made a 31-ball 38 with help of three fours and two sixes, on the first ball of the over.Ishan came down the track to a shortish delivery but ended up slicing it in the air over extra cover due to the extra bounce.The SRH skipper, who never took his eyes off the ball, ran back from mid-off while moving to his right and then outstretched his hands to complete the catch which looked quite easy at the end.If the first one was terrific then what followed on the penultimate delivery of the over was a stunner. Suryakumar checked his drive on a Jansen cutter and ended up chipping it to the left of mid-off.An alert Markram leapt in the air to his left and took an acrobatic catch. Suryakumar's stay was cut short to 7 off three balls and that included a six from the previous delivery."

                            "summary": "MS Dhoni had a mixed day with the gloves in hand in the IPL 2023 match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. In the second over of the RCB chase, he was late to react to an outside edge from Faf du Plessis and the ball flew towards the boundary. It proved to be costly for CSK as du Plessis, who was at nought at the time, went on to smash 62 off 33 balls. But Dhoni made a solid comeback by taking two skiers of Glenn Maxwell and du Plessis to not only redeem himself but also swing CSK back into the contest. Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni after RCB vs CSK IPL 2023 match(IPL)While taking Maxwell's catch, Dhoni had to change the position of his gloves at the last moment. After completing the catch, the CSK skipper immediately went to the umpire and complained about the positioning of the spidercam.After CSK's narrow eight-run win, Devon Conway, who was adjudged Player of the Match for his brilliant 83 off 45 balls, indicated it wasn't easy for players to go about their job seamlessly with the shadow of the hovering spider cam causing problems. He added that things shouldn't come to a point where technology interferes with the game.It's nice to have that technology to show different angles of the game but there come a point where (it) can't get too involved and interfere with the game. MS (Dhoni) was probably trying to speak to the umpires, saying 'don't get too close to the action and try to avoid too much (of what's) going on, said Conway.It (interference) happened a couple of times where the ball had got very close to the spider cam as well as the wires, that can obviously put a fielder off. I think Faf stepped away a couple of times because the shadows of the spidercam were in his way. It's obviously a little bit testing for guys, he said.Conway, Ajinkya Rahane and Shivam Dube played a pivotal role with the bat, scoring at a strike rate of more than 180 to help CSK post the big total.Tonight (Monday) was a really good surface to bat on, so for us to get those big totals it's about trying to create a strike rate of around 200-plus, said Conway at the post-match press conference.The New Zealander said that though he was some way off the 200-plus strike rate, he was happy Rahane (37 runs, 185 strike rate), Dube (52, 192.59), Ambati Rayudu (14, 233.33) and Moeen Ali (19 not out, 211.11), had brilliant strike rates.I didn't manage to achieve that (200-plus rate) but some of the work done by the other players, like Ajinkya, Dube, Rayudu and Moeen Ali in the end, they all chipped in with really good strike rates and that's what got us to a very competitive total.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

                            "summary": "A wave of yellow washed over the Chinnaswamy Stadium, and CSK and RCB treated their fans to another high-scoring thrillerCSK fans turned out in huge numbers to soak in the MS Dhoni experience in Bengaluru • BCCIThe M Chinnaswamy Stadium was predominantly yellow. Hours before the marquee match between RCB and CSK , hundreds of fans had queued at the ticket counter. They fully expected to be rejected, but wanted to try anyway.Earlier, there was similar fervour at the team hotel two kilometres down the road. Security personnel were told to reserve entry only for hotel guests once fans packed the coffee shop on the ground floor. They were waiting for one man, and the moment he stepped out of the elevator and onto the long walkway leading to the team bus, the coffee shop emptied quickly. Everyone had made a beeline towards MS DhoniWith CSK's fan army descending on Bengaluru in huge numbers, you could have mistaken this to be the Chepauk or anywhere in Chennai.It was Dhoni versus Virat Kohli , after all. Perhaps for one last time in the IPL, given the two sides don't have a second league fixture this season, unless of course they meet in the playoffs.The only real 'home advantage' that RCB enjoys is their crowd support. Not the flat pitch or the small boundaries. Going by the number of yellow jerseys at the Chinnaswamy, that crowd support had been eroded to 50-50 at best. It was the first time the two sides were playing in Bengaluru since the pandemic; and this fixture has usually been an explosive, high-scoring contest.Monday night was no different. For the second time, CSK and RCB smashed the most sixes - 33 - in an IPL game. The previous occasion was in 2018 , when Dhoni walked into the chase with 132 needed off 66, and smacked seven maximums on his own.Mohammed Siraj had suffered that night, going for 48 in four wicketless overs. His failed attempts at nailing wide yorkers dispatched repeatedly by Dhoni's powerful bat swing. The much-improved Siraj who steamed in last night, however, was perhaps the reason RCB were chasing 227 and not 247. Coming into this game, his economy in the powerplay was 4.70 and he was even more economical against CSK, taking 1 for 6 in his first two overs.Rough estimates suggest that CSK had more support than RCB at the Chinnaswamy Stadium • BCCIDevon Conway is the most recent of CSK's deceptively destructive openers, much like M Vijay, Mike Hussey and Faf du Plessis - now the opposition captain - before him. His 45-ball 83 set the tone for this high-scoring contest, and eventually earned him the Player of the Match award.Shivam Dube loves playing RCB ever since they released him after spending INR 5 crore to buy him at the 2018 auction. Last night was more of the same. His method was simple: stand-and-deliver to balls in his swinging arc. Each of his five sixes during his 27-ball 52 was different, but all were smashed whistle-clean onto the roof, near the DJ console, into the second tier, and the hospitality boxes.Despite the powerful batting performance, Dhoni was slightly testy on the field. Did he expect the defence to be any different? Definitely not.In the second over of RCB's chase, two balls after Maheesh Theekshana dropped a catch at mid-off, Dhoni himself put down a chance. It was the kind of catch he'd take 99 times out of 100, but he didn't even lay a glove on the ball.Du Plessis made him pay. His and Glenn Maxwell's sensational six hitting threatened to blindside CSK. Wincing in pain because of a bruised rib that needed regular medical attention, du Plessis raced to his fifty off 23 balls. Maxwell got there in 24. The ferocity of their chase had Hussey, CSK's batting coach, sitting in the dugout with his hands on either cheek. You couldn't have found a better expression than that to describe a jaw drop.After dropping one early on, MS Dhoni took two high-pressure catches off Glenn Maxwell and Faf du Plessis • Associated PressUsually not a man of many words on the field, Dhoni was seen talking to his fast bowlers often last night. He's used to having the experience of Dwayne Bravo and Deepak Chahar to call on, but now CSK had the inexperienced Tushar Deshpande Akash Singh and Matheesha Pathirana taking on the marauding RCB batters. Dhoni ran instructions to his rookies - wonky knees be dammed - and often patted them on the back. There was a match to win.And when the first chance at redeeming himself came along - a steepling catch off a Maxwell slog - Dhoni allayed any fears CSK fans may have had of Theekshana having to catch it, by calling for it himself and waving everyone else out of the way. He did not celebrate though, and instead walked over to the umpire to tell them how close the ball had come to making contact with the spider-cam cables.Dhoni then did something even more unusual. He reviewed a not-out lbw decision against Shahbaz Ahmed even though it was clear the ball from Theekshana had pitched far outside leg stump. At 143 for 3 in the 13th over, RCB were still ahead.Then came the turning point of the chase. Moeen Ali had just been walloped for two sixes, while bowling flat and short. You couldn't tell what Dhoni told his bowler while the ball was being retrieved, but Moeen immediately began giving his delivery more air. Two balls later, he forced a top edge from du Plessis. Another steepling chance, extremely similar to the Maxwell dismissal, and once again Dhoni called and caught it."

                            "summary": "By India Today Sports Desk: 20-year-old Sri Lanka fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana recalled how MS Dhoni played a big role in helping keep the Chennai Super Kings calm even as they were defending a mammoth total of 226 against Royal Challengers Bangalore in a thrilling IPL 2023 match on Monday, April 17. CSK had a big total to defend but it was not smooth sailing as they managed just an 8-run win as RCB threatened to pull off the highest-successful chase in the history of the IPL on a night when bowlers were taken to the cleaners at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.advertisementA stunning 83 from Devon Conway and a 27-ball 52 from Shivam Dube after a quickfire 37 from Ajinkya Rahane gave CSK 226. However, MS Dhoni told the team at the mid-innings break that it's not going to be easy defending target in front of small boundaries at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.Speaking to CSk after the thrilling IPL match in which 33 sixes were hit and 444 runs were scored, Matheesha Pathirana said Dhoni calmed the team down in the mid-innings break and asked them not to be complacent after scoring 226.Notably, CSK managed to defend the target, days after RCB faield to defend a 212-run target agianst Lucknow Super Giants at the iconic venue where defending targets have been difficult.After the first innings, our captain said that this was a good score for us but he told us not to take it too easy because of the wicket and ground conditions. It is very easy to chase the target, the young pacer said.RCB got off to a poor start as they lost Virat Kohli as early as the first over and No. 3 batter Mahipal Lomror for 0. However, captain Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell tore into the CSK bowling attack, stitching a record 126-run stand in just 61 balls. RCB raced to 75 for 2 at the end of the powerplay and gave CSK a huge scare.After the powerplay, they scored 75-odd runs. After that, the captain spoke to us and he told us not to panic because in cricket, things can be good and bad as well. He said 'be calm', Pathirana added.Pathirana played a key role in helping CSK defend the target as he came back from two poor overs to give away just 14 runs in his last 2 overs.Pathirana nailed his yorkes to perfection at the death as RCB lost their plot and conceded 2 crucial points.After my 2 overs, I think I gave away 28 runs. After those two overs, I was a bit nervous. Our captain ame and told me not to worry. He asked me to be calm and trust my strength and I think I did that, he added."

And no other batters has scored as many runs at a single venue in IPL as Kohli has amassed in Chinnaswamy. Combine the two for in run-chase scenario and Kohli becomes the most formidable batter in the RCB line-up for MS Dhoni's men. And with the sublime start that he has had in IPL 2023, the India star was expected to continue the same on Monday night, but it unfortunately ended in a bizarre dismissal for six runs in the very first over of the innings. But his incredible act for the bowler, a CSK fresher, after the match had internet talking. Royal Challengers Bangalore batter Virat Kohli(PTI)Kohli had started off with a boundary in the first over where Dhoni had handed the responsibility to Akash Singh, who was playing his second game in his IPL career. However, in the fourth ball, the back of a length delivery took the inside edge of the bat as Kohli swung hard at it, hit his shoes and bounced off it to rattle the stumps. The former RCB skipper was left numb as he stood there for a while before he walked towards the dug out with his head down in sheer disappointment. Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, his wife, who was in the stands, was left at loss of words.Akash Singh, the 20-year-old bowler from Rajasthan, was elated to have picked the biggest wicket of his career and only the third in his IPL career.After the match, when Dhoni was having a word with Sanjay Manjrekar in the post-match presentation assessing CSK's performance in the game, Kohli was spotted having an intense chat with Akash as the right-arm pacer listened to the modern-era great. The incredible act from Kohli was hailed by many on Twitter.Here is how Twitter reacted…Akash had gone unsold at the IPL 2023 auction last December and was only picked by CSK as a replacement for Mukesh Choudhary, for a base price of INR 20 lakh. Heading into the IPL, all he had managed was nine T20 appearances in domestic circuit where he picked seven wickets at an economy rate of 7.87. He had made his debut in T20s for Rajasthan in 2019 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy before he was picked in India's U19 World Cup campaign who had finished as runners-up in 2020 in South Africa. He later moved from Rajasthan to Nagaland ahead of the 2022-23 domestic season.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

In the second video, the former BCCI president was seem avoiding Kohli as went past DC coach Ricky Ponting to jump the queue as players were shaking hands after the match.Although the two videos hinted that all is still not well between the two since that row in November 2021, Kohli went a step ahead of clarify it after he unfollowed Ganguly on Instagram despite the latter still following him.On Monday, ahead of RCB's game against CSK at home, a fresh video emerged on Twitter involving Kohli and Ganguly. In the video, the DC director was seen blatantly ignoring the former India skipper as he walked past the RCB dug out and what followed was a menacing look from Kohli. However, other members of the DC unit did stop to say hello to Kohli, who was all padded up, ready to open for the team.Watch the video below:Kohli had later scored his second fifty-run knock at the Chinnaswamy stadium in the ongoing IPL 2023 season as RCB won by 23 runs and denied DC another opportunity at opening their account. Delhi, who remain at the bottom of the points table, are the only team in the tournament who are yet to win their first match.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

And 'social media sleuths' are only fanning the flames by focusing on events that seem to be leaving a far more lasting impression than the match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals itself.It is unlikely any Indian cricket fan would be unaware that 'all is not well' between the two former captains; Kohli's alleged feud with the former BCCI president has been widely reported. Now, the duo's rift is in the news again after their teams' last IPL 2023 clash on Saturday.After RCB's 23-run victory over Delhi Capitals on Saturday, three videos became the match's highlight and went viral on social media. One showed Kohli staring Ganguly down, while the latter was sitting in the DC dugout, two overs before RCB's triumph. The second video captured the DC director of cricket bypassing coach Ricky Ponting to greet the RCB players — and in the process, skipping a handshake with Kohli.The next day, a new video surfaced from the same game, where Ganguly appeared to ignore Kohli as he sat ready to open for the match. The footage showed Ganguly blatantly ignoring Kohli, whereas other DC players and support staff greeted the batter. A menacing stare from the former RCB skipper followed towards the DC director.What transpired next between the two cricketing heroes is a tale for posterity. Kohli went on to solidify the 'possible rift' rumour by unfollowing Ganguly on Instagram. Ganguly, who until Sunday was following the RCB player, was not willing to be left behind in the game — and on Monday, he too unfollowed Kohli on the social media platform.The fallout — which goes all the way back to the November 2021 incident and started with Kohli's removal from ODI captaincy — is evidently still raw between the two, and neither appears to have moved on.Gloves are off, ladies and gentlemen!ALSO READ:"

Recently, a not-so-subtle and less-than-cordial interaction between Ganguly and Kohli during an IPL match between RCB and DC has captured the attention of some fans.But now, the rift has taken a turn for the worse, as both people have unfollowed each other on Instagram This happened a day after the DC mentor avoided shaking hands with Kohli after RCB beat DC by 23 runs at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Saturday.Also, one particular video went viral on social media platforms where Virat Kohli was seen giving Ganguly a death stare after taking a catch during RCB's game with DC. RCB won the match by 23 runs.In a video circulating on social media from Saturday's game, Ganguly was spotted skipping the queue to avoid a handshake with Kohli after DC head coach Ricky Ponting stopped the RCB batter during the post-match customary handshakes.Here’s the post:Here's what some other Twitter users had to say about the rift.Notably, Kohli stepped down as T20I captain and was later sacked as the captain of the ODI team during Ganguly's term as BCCI president.A week later, Kohli made a stunning revelation at a press conference during India's tour of South Africa in 2021 that there was no communication between him and the selection committee about the change in ODI leadership and he was told hours before the selection meeting for Test series that selectors have decided that he won't be the captain.Kohli had contradicted Ganguly that the selectors had sounded him over the captaincy issue.Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly praised Kohli for his impressive form during the Asia Cup back in 2022. He even broke his century duck during India's final match of the tournament against Afghanistan. “I think he is more skilful than I’m,” Ganguly had commented."

The game ended after 44 moves and four hours of play.The World Chess Championship match between Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi has already produced four decisive results in just the first six games, something which was last seen in the Korchnoi-Karpov match of 1981 and the legendary 1972 match between Spassky and Fischer. Both players are setting the stage for an unpredictable and exciting fight not seen for a long time in a chess match.My role to bridge gap between computer screen and what a player experiences at the table: Viswanathan AnandViswanathan Anand is one of the commentators for the World Chess Championships. (File)One of the world’s greatest chess minds who, when seated across the board, could see well into the future is consumed by a nagging fear that, from behind the microphone, he’d ‘miss something obvious that everyone in the world can see’.“My fear,” says Viswanathan Anand, “is I’m sitting there rambling and then they play something (else)… I’d be slightly embarrassed. That’s the danger of not having a computer. One of the things I tried in Dubai (during the 2021 World Championship) and I stuck to here was almost never consulting a computer.”These fears, as it turns out, have proven unfounded. In fact, the five-time world champion almost flawlessly predicts moves and foresees the ‘breakdown of thoughts’ of champions and challengers alike with his quick-witted analysis, typical self-effacing humour, and without any help from the supercomputers.

                            "summary": "The Fide World Chess Championship 2023 is quickly becoming amongst most explosive and entertaining contest in recent times for the chess enthusiasts. Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren have won hearts with their fighting spirit, logging four decisive games out of six in this 14-game contest being played at Astana, Kazakhstan.With the score even at 3-3, the race for the title remains wide open. Interestingly the three decisive results were registered by the player wielding white pieces, Ding winning twice while Nepo won a game each with white and black pieces. Another noticeable feature has been the variety of openings employed, keeping the other on their toes in the initial stages. There have been errors and brilliance, especially in the last three games which were all decisive.The tournament did take off on a bittersweet note, especially since quite a few voices minced no words in questioning the credibility of this event after Magnus Carlsen, the highest-ever rated player decided against defending his title, citing lack of motivation.Also Read | Nepo steps on the acceleratorNepo had won the Candidates 2022 to emerge as challenger for Carlsen’s throne but after Carlsen’s refusal, Ding Liren - the runner-up in the Candidates - got an opportunity to fight for the world title.Magnus, dubbed Mean Machine, has been sorely missed at times. However, Ding and Nepo have been consistent in their efforts, trying to exploit the smallest of advantage on the board. In fact, the contest has become unpredictable and thrilling with both players winning in tandem and no firm favourite arising even at the halfway stage of the event.Their contrasting styles have also added to the flavour of the clash, Nepo staying true to his aggressive approach and Ding preferring positional play. One of Ding’s problem so far has been an inability to keep pace with the clock while Nepo’s impulsiveness has had him overlooking a few better appearing continuations.On Tuesday, at the halfway stage of the event, Nepo will wield Whites while Ding with a victory just before the rest day will be psychologically better placed."

Remarkably, the world’s best player isn’t even playing!Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi are trying to win each and every game, which, in the spirit of the sport, has long been forgotten due to the high stakes in such a match. (You can also read Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay’s insightful analysis for Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, Game 4, Game 5 & Game 6 )My role to bridge gap between computer screen and what a player experiences at the table: Viswanathan AnandSo much so that Ding lost Game 7 on Tuesday due to time trouble, giving Nepo a 4-3 lead in the match. It was such a strange result because Ding, despite playing with Black pieces, had the upper hand for most part of the match.I say strange, but by all means it’s spectacular too. When did we last witness a Championship game where both players are trying to turn the tables on each other from a very early stage? We have always known that mind games are a huge part of these Championships, but this psychological battle is taking it to another level.In all the games, both players have tried to outthink each other. In Game 7, Nepo opened with his favorite King Pawn. Trust Ding to pull out a surprise. He played The French Defence, an opening he played regularly in his childhood but had stopped playing way back in 2013.Maybe, it also had a lot to do with his second. Ding’s second, Richard Rapport is a French Defence expert, so it became clear that the Chinese had something up his sleeve, particularly because Nepo always meets French Defence with Tarrasch Variations, named after former World No.2 Sigbert Tarrasch of Germany.Nepo chose to move his Bishop to c4 instead of the usual square d3 when Ding deviated from the regular opening by playing a new move on his eighth turn.AdvertisementSo, from Move 8, it was clear that the game was in a new position. At this stage, Ding had a psychological edge as he was playing a position better known to him than his opponent. Nepo rightly played the next part of the game very cautiously but also committed slight inaccuracies between moves 17-20, passing on the initiative to Ding.On move 21, Ding decided to sacrifice ‘an exchange’ i.e. to give a Rook for a Bishop. This resulted in an extremely sharp position with Ding trying to initiate an attack against Nepo’s King.However, Nepo kept on defending stubbornly. When the game is in a new position, players have to work out new strategies and more importantly, think about the repercussions their next move could have. Since Ding was largely playing attacking moves, this resulted in him getting into severe time trouble.AdvertisementUnlike other tournaments, players don’t get any time increment till move 40, which seemed to make things really difficult for Ding.Despite time shortage, on move 31, Ding chose to complicate the battle with an inaccuracy which was followed by another on the next move. This enabled Nepo to fortify his position. Ding followed up those two errors with a decisive blunder on move 33, thereby allowing Nepo to suddenly get a completely winning position.Ding kept on making wrong moves and was forced to resign the game, running out of time.One could tell that this was a heavy loss for Ding as he was almost in tears. He couldn’t even talk properly after the game. He went for the all-out kill and lost.But he has only himself to blame. He’s not showing the wisdom professional players of his stature should do. He was in command of the game and didn’t have to force the issue. He should’ve played simple moves to get out of time trouble. He tried to use complicated moves when there was hardly any time. This is clearly a lack of maturity on some level.AdvertisementHe should take a leaf out of the book of our young Indian Grandmasters. Just look at the likes of D Gukesh, R Pragganandhaa, or even Vidit Gujrathi. They have such a professional approach and know when exactly to take a risk and when not to. Ding should learn that finding the best move all the time may not be the best solution.The only good thing for him is that he has four more games with white pieces and Nepo has three. It’s going to be a battle for the ages.Advertisement(Pravin Thipsay is a Grandmaster and recipient of the Arjuna Award.

In all, CSK bowled as many as 11 extras against RCB.Dhoni was not looking happy because he has mentioned it before that he wants the bowlers to reduce the number of no balls and wides, Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.It shouldn't go to a stage where Dhoni gets banned and CSK has to take the field without their captain.The four-time IPL champions had leaked 18 runs in extras against Lucknow Super Giants earlier and Dhoni had warned them to cut down on extras or be ready to play under a new captain.Dhoni has said earlier too to restrict wides and no balls. And to bowl six wides, is really disappointing, Sehwag said.Seamer Tushar Deshpande conceded three wides to continue his poor run in the IPL, but Sehwag was livid with their spinner Maheesh Theekshana for bowling wide.It's really disappointing when you bowl so many wides, especially by a spinner. At least they should control their wides.With the kind of knee injury he has, it appears he might play only a handful of matches more anyway. He is constantly pushing himself, but if his bowlers are bowling so many wides and no balls, then Dhoni will have to take rest, Sehwag added.A knee injury to Ben Stokes means that the English stalwart is unable to bowl. CSK's attack is also plagued by injuries to Deepak Chahar, Mukesh Choudhary and Sisanda Mangala.I've been saying from day one Chennai is thin on bowling. It's their weak link. They have to focus on their bowling. They have to manage with this, they will have to bowl better, execute better, Sehwag said.Sehwag further pointed out that CSK bowlers had 37 dot balls, but despite that, RCB went on to score 2188.So it meant the runs were scored in 14 overs! They (RCB) almost reached the target because they were hitting in fours and sixes.CSK bowling will have to buck up and bring out the best in them, execute their plans properly. Be it yorkers, slower ones. They will also have to improve a bit in fielding, he said, referring to their four dropped catches."

Despite putting up towering scores while batting first, their bowlers haven't quite been able to choke the opposition batters. CSK had to battle till the last over to win the match by 8 runs after putting 227 on the board against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Monday. Injuries to key bowlers like Deepak Chahar, Mukesh Choudhary, Sisanda Magala, Ben Stokes and Simarjeet Singh have left their seam attack thin but the biggest concern has been discipline and accuracy. MS Dhoni and Virender SehwagCSK bowlers have been guilty of bowling multiple wides and no-balls in this IPL. Even against RCB on Monday, they bowled six wides. Such has been the issue of extras with the CSK bowlers that captain MS Dhoni, who is known to be one of the calmest cricketers going around, was forced to issue a warning. They'll have to bowl no no-balls and fewer wides. We are bowling too many extra deliveries and need to cut them out otherwise they'll be playing under a new captain, Dhoni had said after beating LSG earlier this month.CSK had bowled 13 wides in that much. While the number has come down, it is yet to reach a manageable point. Former India opener Virender Sehwag said if this continues like this then the day is not far when Dhoni, the CSK captain, will face a suspension due to repeated slow over-rate offences.Also Read | BCCI takes action against Virat Kohli for aggressive behaviour in RCB vs CSKDhoni was not looking happy because he has mentioned it before that he wants the bowlers to reduce the number of no-balls and wides. CSK had bowled two-three years of extra and against RCB, they bowled another extra over. It shouldn't go to a stage where Dhoni gets banned and CSK has to take the field without their captain.With the kind of knee injury he has, it appears he might play only a handful of matches more anyway. He is constantly pushing himself but if his bowlers are bowling so many wides and no-balls, then Dhoni will have to take rest, Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Tushar Deshpande, who has been given away the most extras for CSK in this year's IPL, once again bowled three wides against RCB but Sehwag was more miffed with spinner Maheesh Theekshana. It is especially disheartening to see the spinners bowl wides. These are things under your control, he said.Terming CSK's bowling attack 'weak', Sehwag said if the four-time champions are unable to sort this out quickly then it will make their life difficult going ahead in the tournament.I'm saying from day 1 that CSK's bowling is weak. They need to work on that department. But what more can they do? They will have to use whatever resources they have this season. The bowlers have to be more accurate. If look at their performance against RCB, they have bowled 30-35 dot balls so they didn't let RCB score a run in six overs. Despite that, they ended up conceding 218 because they leaked far too many sixes and fours, he said.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

However, the delivery ended up being a tad too off-target as it went past Rahul Tripathi's attempted flick and into the wicketkeeper's gloves. However, the ball passed close by the willow, provoking both Ishan Kishan and Arjun to go up in a loud appeal with the latter hopeful of earning his maiden IPL scalp in just his second game in the tournament. Confusion ensued as instead of making the signal for a wide or raising his finger, umpire Nitin Menon instead started walking towards his square-leg counterpart while speaking through his headset with the third umpire. Even Arjun flared his arms in shock to question what was going on, only for Menon to eventually signal to the third umpire to check for a bump ball. Replays showed that the ball had pitched well short of Tripathi and was nowhere close to being a bump ball while also proving that the batter had not got a nick."

Bowled out for 143, Ireland couldn't do much better following on, finishing on 168 with Harry Tector, Curtis Campher and George Dockrell getting starts.The innings and 280-run victory gives Sri Lanka a 1-0 lead in the two-match Test series. Here we take a look at the talking points from the Test match.A dominant performance by Sri Lanka in the first Test 💪#SLvIRE | https:t.co9GLo0NPMGD pic.twitter.com4j0ZOG7Bxz — ICC (@ICC) April 18, 2023Dinesh Chandimal continues his incredible runChandimal has been in good form in Test cricket, making over 1000 runs in his last nine Test matches, averaging 91 in the format with three hundreds and five half-centuries.His unbeaten hundred came after a well-set platform, and led Sri Lanka to a massive first innings total. Chandimal's purple patch is one he hasn't managed previously in a career that is more than a decade long.In seven of these last nine Tests, Chandimal has made at least one fifty-plus score. This includes a career-best 206* against Australia at this very same venue.Ireland spinners struggleIreland spinners made a decent impression in Bangladesh, but here in Galle, against a strong batting line-up, they couldn't quite make inroads.Andy McBrine, George Dockrell and Ben White picked up three wickets between them, but conceded close to 400 runs, each going at more than four runs per over.SIX: Harry Tector smashes a short delivery | T20WC 2022Promising batters for the futureIreland may have managed just 143 and 168 in the two innings here, but across the Bangladesh series and this Test, there was enough on display to suggest that the team can develop its red-ball batting.The likes of Lorcan Tucker, Harry Tector, Curtis Campher and James McCollum showed the tenacity and resilience required in batters in the longest format. For a group of players who haven't had too much first-class cricket behind them, these were appreciable performances in alien conditions.Tucker's fine century in Bangladesh was followed up by a 73-ball 45 in the first innings here. Tector showed character in both innings, facing over 150 balls across both innings.Prabath Jayasuriya has been sensational in his six career Tests so far.Prabath Jayasuriya's incredible startIn six Tests thus far, Prabath Jayasuriya has five five-wicket hauls in an innings and two match hauls of 10 wickets or more. The left-arm spinner, who won the Player of the Match award, finished with figures of 10108.He has already raced to 43 Test wickets, 39 of those coming in Galle alone, where he has now played four Tests and taken five five-wicket hauls.His tally of 43 wickets after six Tests is the joint-third-best in Test cricket history. Only Charles Turner (50) and Vernon Philander (45) have more after the first six Tests.The second and final Test begins in Galle from April 24."

We've got to find a way to harness the skills we've developed in 50-overs cricket and bring them into the Test arena.I don't know what that looks like. We don't have a number of Test matches where we can plan out a structure, so we'll have to do it differently to other Test nations.It's going to be difficult and we're going to have Test matches like this, but we're not putting expectations on guys, we just want them to go out and express themselves and enjoy this challenge, because it is tough and it's only going to get tougher.While he admitted Ireland succumbed to some lapses of concentration, Balbirnie played down the suggestion that tiredness had contributed to the chastening defeat in Galle.It's just so different because mentally it's very taxing, especially in that heat, he added.That's why it's such a great game. You're never out of the game in the field, particularly when there's stuff happening.There may have been lapses of concentration, that happens, but like I said I don't want to be critical because it's tough cricket and the guys fronted up in a lot of aspects."

The pitch has begun to take significant turn too and Ireland will likely need to battle hard on Tuesday to avoid a defeat inside three days. Sri Lanka declared their first innings on 5916 declared.Sri Lanka moved towards a big win in Galle on Day II, with Dinesh Chandimal and Sadeera Samarawickrama hitting unbeaten centuries, before Prabath Jayasuriya claimed five wickets in the 19 overs he delivered before stumps.Jayasuriya collected five wickets for 42 runs after Vishwa Fernando had removed two Ireland batters in the second over of the innings. Jayasuriya generated drift and dip, as well as biting turn on occasion.Harry Tector, who had put on a 70-run stand with James McCollum for the third wicket, was Jayasuriya’s first victim. The bowler drew Tector into a drive by looping it up, but collected his outside edge with dip and spin, the ball eventually finding its way to slip.Two balls later, he would get the tetchy Curtis Campher pushing one gently to cover.He would later get Peter Moor caught behind, and George Dockrell lbw, but Jayasuriya’s best dismissal was his third, and would have been fatal to many more experienced batters than McCollum.This was a tossed up ball, drifting in, drawing the batter into a forward defence, before beating the outside edge by a whisker, then clipping the top of off stump. They went to stumps with wicketkeeper-batter Lorcan Tucker, and Andy McBrine at the crease.Ireland had started the day nicely, with Campher dismissing nightwatchman Jayasuriya in the second over of the morning, before McBrine trapped Dhananjaya de Silva in front not long after.Samarawickrama and Chandimal then put on an unbeaten 183 runs together. Samarawickrama got his maiden Test century, in his first Test in more than five years, as he preyed on the short lengths that Ireland continued to feed him. Chandimal’s century was the 14th of his career.“There was no threat in the pitch and we wanted to bat only once and put the opposition under pressure,” Samarawickrama said later. “We have declared at the right time because as the pitch got older it started to spin.”Brief scores: Sri Lanka 5916 decl (D. Chandimal 102 n.o., S. Samarawickrama 104 n.o.; C. Campher 284) Ireland 1177 (J. McCollom 35; P. Jayasuriya 542). At stumps, Day IIWritten with inputs from APPTI"

Photograph: ICCTwitterLeft-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya finished with a match haul of 10 wickets as Sri Lanka crushed Ireland by an innings and 280 runs inside three days of the opening Test in Galle on Tuesday.This was Sri Lanka's biggest victory margin in Test cricket, while Ireland slumped to their fifth consecutive defeat since becoming a Test nation in 2018.Electing to bat, Sri Lanka seized early control of the match and racked up 591-6 before declaring their first innings at the Galle International Stadium.Captain Dimuth Karunaratne (179) and number three batsman Kusal Mendis (140) laid the foundation for a big total before Dinesh Chandimal (102) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (104) smashed unbeaten hundreds to consolidate their position.Ireland were skittled out for 143 in their first innings with left-arm spinner Jayasuriya (7-52) being the wrecker-in-chief.Made to follow on, Ireland managed 168 in their second innings with Ramesh Mendis (4-76) and Jayasuriya (3-56) claiming the bulk of the wickets.It's another test match under the belt for a lot of our cricketers, Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said of their experience.A lot of us want to play Test cricket but we got a real taste of that over the last three days.Sri Lanka at home are a daunting prospect for any team, never mind a team that hasn't played a lot of Test cricket.Certainly there are learnings but we've got to find a way to compete better.Karunaratne heaped praise on Jayasuriya, who claimed player of the match award.When I give him the ball, he knows exactly what to do, and he keeps doing it. He is very patient, the opener said.The second Test begins at the same venue on Monday."

They head into this top-of-the-table clash with contrasting recent results. Royals' last outing was a come-from-behind win against Gujarat Titans while Super Giants' loss against Punjab Kings was only their second since the start of IPL 2022 batting first.And that's just the start of the contrasts. Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal score runs at 11.20 per over as a pair for Royals - the fastest among openers at IPL 2023. Kyle Mayers and KL Rahul go at 8.43 for Super Giants and are only faster than Kolkata Knight Riders' Rahmanullah Gurbaz and N Jagadeesan among those who have opened together multiple times this year. Subsequently Royals score 9.76 on average per over in the powerplay - the second quickest - as opposed to Super Giants' 8.03 - third slowest.In fact, the combined strike rate of the top four Super Giants - Mayers, Rahul, Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya - is 126.01, significantly lower than Royals' 149.21. They are largely driven by Mayers, who tees off against the new ball and strikes at 168. Rahul's restrained approach and Hooda's struggles have not helped.On the other hand, each of Royals' top-order batters has looked to consciously take the aggressive route. Apart from Buttler and Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Devdutt Padikkal, Riyan Parag and R Ashwin have batted in the top four for them.Where the two teams are quite similar is in their finishing prowess - thanks largely to Nicholas Pooran and Shimron Hetmyer. Nos. 5 to 8 for Super Giants score a cumulative 167 per 100 balls while those batters for Royals strike at close to 160.Pooran's 141 runs this season have come at a strike rate of 216.92 and Super Giants' heist against Royal Challengers Bangalore was largely thanks to his 62. Hetmyer has been doing something similar for Royals, scoring at a strike rate of 184.84. He trains with the mindset of finishing games from improbable situations and helped them defeat Gujarat Titans in such a scenario to move to the top of the points table.Despite having a different starting method, Super Giants are second on the table behind Royals. Royals' homecoming at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur - they played their first two home games in Guwahati - could be an exciting clash of contrasts.IPL 2023 form guideRajasthan Royals WWWLW (last five matches, most recent first) Lucknow Super Giants LWWLWTeam news - More bench time for Quinton de Kock?Mayers has been a major reason behind Super Giants' quick starts and it could mean Quinton de Kock spends more time on the bench.Buttler's finger injury saw him being subbed out via the Impact Player rule against Chennai Super Kings but he fielded in Royals' last outing.Toss and Impact Player strategyRajasthan RoyalsRiyan Parag was left out against Super Kings, when Royals opted to go in with an extra bowling option even in their bat-first XI. That aside, they've generally subbed out a batter for a bowler (Sandeep Sharma or Kuldeep Sen) in each of the matches and that trend could perhaps continue. But both Padikkal and Parag have had a largely tough time in this competition. Will that force Royals to look at Joe Root, who can chip in with some offspin against a line-up that has enough left-handers?Probable bat-first XI: 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 2 Jos Butter, 3 Sanju Samson (capt & wk), 4 Devdutt Padikkal, 5 Riyan Parag, 6 Shimron Hetmyer, 7 Dhruv Jurel 8 R Ashwin, 9 Adam Zampa 10 Trent Boult, 11 Yuzvendra ChahalProbable field-first XI: 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 2 Jos Butter, 3 Sanju Samson (capt & wk), 4 Riyan Parag, 5 Shimron Hetmyer, 6 Dhruv Jurel 7 R Ashwin, 8 Adam Zampa 9 Trent Boult, 10 Yuzvendra Chahal, 11 Sandeep SharmaLucknow Super GiantsAyush Badoni has been Super Giants' Impact Player, except in the last game, when they opted to bring K Gowtham in for Mayers, who was already dismissed. If they are chasing, they would perhaps sub a bowler out.Possible bat-first XI: 1 KL Rahul (capt), 2 Kyle Mayers, 3 Deepak Hooda, 4 Krunal Pandya, 5 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 6 Marcus Stoinis, 7 Ayush Badoni, 8 K Gowtham, 9 Ravi Bishnoi, 10 Avesh Khan, 11 Mark WoodPossible bowl-first XI: 1 KL Rahul (capt), 2 Kyle Mayers, 3 Deepak Hooda, 4 Krunal Pandya, 5 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 6 Marcus Stoinis, 7 K Gowtham, 8 Ravi Bishnoi, 9 Avesh Khan, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Yudhvir SinghAmit MishraStats that matter Super Giants are yet to beat Royals in the IPL. Royals won both of their clashes last season.Among batters with at least 50 runs against Boult in the IPL, Rahul has the fourth-best strike rate. The left-arm quick has dismissed Rahul twice though.Royals have won 32 of the 47 IPL matches played at Sawai Mansingh Stadium - a win percentage of 68, only bettered by Super Kings at Chepauk.Since IPL 2022, Buttler has been dismissed against spin only twice in 17 innings and has the best average among those who have aggregated at least 100 runs against spin."

The KL Rahul-led LSG team has three wins and two losses so far, and they will be looking to get back to their winning ways against the table-toppers. Despite being a team with immense talent, LSG has missed a few opportunities in the middle overs, leading to their defeats. In their previous match against the Punjab Kings, LSG couldn't score enough runs in the middle overs, which resulted in them being 10-15 runs short in the end.While LSG has several power hitters in their batting lineup, including Kyle Mayers, Nicholas Pooran, and Marcus Stoinis, they need to build partnerships and take scoring opportunities more effectively. Additionally, LSG needs to use their bowlers more wisely, such as bringing in Ravi Bishnoi earlier in the game. LSG will also face a tough challenge against the Rajasthan Royals, who have a formidable batting lineup with Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, and Sanju Samson. Furthermore, RR has quality spinners such as Yuzvendra Chahal, Adam Zampa, and Ravichandran Ashwin, who can make life difficult for the opposition.Check LIVE Scores and Updates from RR vs LSG IPL 2023 match HERE."

Times of India neither condones nor endorses any of the views shared in this article here.Powerful knock by skipper Sanju Samson led Rajasthan Royals to a stunning three-wicket win over holders Gujarat Titans to stay top of the IPL table on Sunday.Chasing 178 for victory, last year's runners-up Rajasthan depended on Samson's 32-ball 60 and an unbeaten 56 by Hetmyer to achieve their target with four balls to spare in Ahmedabad.However, a moment in the match, when RR was fielding, has triggered memefest on social media.While taking Wriddhiman Saha’s catch, a bizarre collision between Samson, Shimron Hetmyer and Dhruv Jurel almost ensured that the ball would be dropped, before bowler Trent Boult sprang up and took the catch.The moment saw three Rajasthan Royals players converging to grab the catch. Of them, Samson almost managed to lay his hands on the ball but he stumbled and the ball landed safely in the hands of Boult, who was just a bystander so far to the bizarreness.The entire sequence of events that unfolded became a fodder for memes on social media."

NASA decommissioned it after 16 years, in 2018, due to communications difficulties.The US Department of Defense, which is monitoring the satellite, expects the 660-pound spacecraft to re-enter the atmosphere at approximately 9:30 p.m. EDT (7 a.m. IST) on Wednesday, but the timings can vary.While NASA expects most of the spacecraft to burn up as it travels through the atmosphere, some components are expected to survive re-entry.The risk of harm coming to anyone on Earth is low - approximately one in 2,467, the agency said in a statement."

                            "summary": "A dead NASA spacecraft will come crashing back to Earth in the next few days, experts say.NASA's RHESSI satellite, which studied the sun from 2002 until its decommissioning in 2018, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere around 9:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday (April 19; 0130 GMT on April 20), plus or minus 16 hours, according to the latest estimates by the U.S. military.RHESSI (short for Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) isn't a huge satellite. It weighs just 600 pounds (270 kilograms), and the majority of that mass will be converted to ash and vapor during RHESSI's death dive, NASA officials said.However, some components are expected to survive reentry, agency officials wrote in an update on Monday (opens in new tab) (April 17). The risk of harm coming to anyone on Earth is low — approximately 1 in 2,467.Related: Getting space junk under control may require an attitude shiftRHESSI's coming plunge is another reminder that Earth orbit is an increasingly crowded and dangerous place.More than 30,000 pieces of orbital debris are currently being tracked by global space surveillance networks, for example. But there are many, many more that are too small for us to keep tabs on.The European Space Agency estimates (opens in new tab) that about 1 million objects between 0.4 inches and 4 inches (1 to 10 centimeters) wide are whizzing around our planet at the moment. And the approximate number of pieces between 0.04 inches (1 millimeter) and 0.4 inches is truly staggering — 130 million or so.Even these tiny shards can do serious damage if they hit a satellite or a crewed spacecraft , given their tremendous velocities: In low Earth orbit, where the International Space Station and many other craft fly, objects move at about 17,500 mph (28,160 kph).And in-space collisions generate many more pieces of space junk, which could lead to more collisions down the road. If enough of those happen, we'd end up with a dreaded cascade known as the Kessler Syndrome, which could seriously hamper our ability to explore and utilize space.The RHESSI satellite launched to low Earth orbit aboard a Pegasus XL rocket in February 2002. The spacecraft studied solar flares and coronal mass ejections using its single science instrument, an imaging spectrometer that recorded X-rays and gamma rays.During its mission tenure, RHESSI recorded more than 100,000 X-ray events, allowing scientists to study the energetic particles in solar flares, NASA officials wrote in Monday's update. The imager helped researchers determine the particles' frequency, location and movement, which helped them understand where the particles were being accelerated.RHESSI will be far from the biggest hunk of space junk to fall to Earth uncontrolled when it comes down. Last November, for instance, the 23-ton (21 metric tons) core stage of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket came crashing back to Earth about five days after it launched the third and final module for the nation's Tiangong space station.That was the fourth Long March 5B mission to date, and all four have featured uncontrolled reentries of the massive core stage."

                            "summary": "How apes transformed from grunting beasts to humans that would go on to build skyscrapers, aeroplanes and advanced computers is one of the greatest questions of science. Now, a new research study might rewrite prevailing narratives about how all that happened.According to the University of Minnesota, for a long time, the story of human evolution surrounded how a densely forested Africa slowly became drier, giving way to open grasslands that eventually caused our distant ape ancestors to abandon trees and start walking on two legs.But according to a new study published in the journal Science on Thursday, the story may not be that simple. Two studies found that early apes lived in a wide variety of habitats. This includes scrublands and wooded grasslands that existed 10 million years earlier than previously known.This suggests that the modern ape anatomy could have evolved among leaf-eating apes in open woodlands instead of fruit-eating apes in forests. This research has led to a new framework for future studies on how apes evolved.During the ten-year-long study, the researchers conducted palaeontological and geological fieldwork across nine fossil site complexes. They collected thousands of fossil plants and animal remains to reconstruct ancient habitats.A part of the research focused on C4 plants, which are found in tropical savannahs today. Previously, they were thought to have been dominant only 10 million years ago. But the study revealed that these grasses were already an important part of the ecosystem more than 21 million years ago.This indicated that open grasslands and scrubs existed much earlier than was previously thought.AdvertisementAccording to The Times, the results of the research suggested that a very early ape, called the Morotopithecus, did not live in a dense jungle as previously thought. But rather, they lived in a more open grassy landscape that was scattered with woodland areas.Morotopithecus had an upright stance but probably did not walk on two legs like humans do. It would have scampered on the floor like a monkey instead.Also read | SpaceX to attempt Starship launch again on Thursday“The femur and lower back anatomy of this ape reveals that it climbed trees the way modern apes do, and this is the earliest evidence for this adaptation by at least seven million years.,” said James Rossie, co-author of the paper, in a press statement.AdvertisementRossie is an Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology in the College of Arts and Sciences at Stony Brook University. According to Rossie, Morotopithecus has dental traits that show that they subsisted on fruits instead of grass.“Morotopithecus is regarded as one of the best representatives of the ancestors to all of the living apes and humans,” said Kieran McNulty, one of the co-authors of the study in Science, to The Times.According to McNulty, scientists have assumed that the upright postures evolved in “closed-canopy forests,” where the branches of the trees touch the branches of other trees. The assumption was also that these apes would not have necessarily come down to the ground.The new research shows that some of these apes, including Morotopithecus, lived in much more open spaces. There would have been trees around but they would have to get down from one tree to get to another.This research can be expanded to create a new framework for studying how environmental changes in Africa and the evolution of apes, who eventually became humans, went hand in hand."

                            "summary": "Researchers shift the narrative of human evolution through paleontological and geological fieldwork.According to new research led by the University of Minnesota, the story of human evolution is not as simple as previously thought. Two studies have found that early apes lived in a wide variety of habitats, including open habitats like scrublands and wooded grasslands, that existed 10 million years earlier than previously known. The research has led to a new framework for future studies regarding ape evolutionary origins. The findings suggest that modern ape anatomy may have evolved in open woodlands among leaf-eating apes rather than in forest-dwelling fruit-eating apes.The story of human evolution has long been a tale of a forested Africa that gradually became drier, giving rise to open grasslands and causing our forest-loving ape ancestors to abandon the trees and become bipedal. Even though ecological and fossil evidence suggested this narrative was too simplistic, the theory remains prominent in many evolutionary scenarios.Two new studies recently published in the journal Science led by researchers at the University of Minnesota put this idea to rest. The findings outline paleoecological reconstructions of early ape fossil sites in eastern Africa dated to the early Miocene Epoch — between 23 and 16 million years ago — showing early apes lived in a wide variety of habitats, including open habitats like scrublands and wooded grasslands that existed 10 million years earlier than previously known.Research findings include:Some of these habitats included substantial C 4 plant biomass, grasses that today characterize tropical savannas, but were thought previously to have become dominant only 10 million years ago.plant biomass, grasses that today characterize tropical savannas, but were thought previously to have become dominant only 10 million years ago. Modern ape anatomy may have evolved in open woodlands among leaf-eating apes rather than in forest-dwelling fruit-eating apes.The combination of open habitats with significant C 4 biomass in the Early Miocene suggests that traditional scenarios regarding the evolution of animal and plant communities in Africa, including the origin of hominins, need to be reconsidered.Researchers across nine fossil site complexes — which included 30 experts from African, North American, and European institutions — conducted paleontological and geological fieldwork, collecting thousands of fossil plant and animal remains and sampling fossil deposits for multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct the ancient habitats.“None of us could have reached these conclusions working in isolation at our individual fossil sites,” said Kieran McNulty, a professor of Anthropology in the College of Liberal Arts, lead author and organizer of the decade-long Research on East African Catarrhine and Hominoid Evolution (REACHE) project. “Working in the fossil record is challenging. We discover hints about past life and need to assemble and interpret them across space and time. It’s like a 4D puzzle, where each team member can only see some of the pieces.”“You go into a project like this not knowing for sure what you will find out, which is exciting. In this case, we realized we were looking at a picture of Early Miocene communities in eastern Africa that is quite different than what we had expected,” said David Fox, a professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department in the College of Science and Engineering. “There was no single ‘ah ha moment’ but over years of field seasons and the steady accumulation of new fossils and new data, we realized that the environments of the earliest apes varied significantly from the traditional picture of forested habitats.”“The findings have transformed what we thought we knew about early apes, and the origin for where, when and why they navigate through the trees and on the ground in multiple different ways,” said Robin Bernstein, program director for biological anthropology at the National Science Foundation. “For the first time, by combining diverse lines of evidence, this collaborative research team tied specific aspects of early ape anatomy to nuanced environmental changes in their habitat in eastern Africa, now revealed as more open and less forested than previously thought. The effort outlines a new framework for future studies regarding ape evolutionary origins.”Continued research at these fossil sites will enhance our understanding of these habitats, especially of finer-grained changes in space and time. Likewise, similar collaborations focused on earlier and later time periods are needed to fully understand the interactions between fossil species and their environments.“This level of cooperation among different teams is unique in paleoanthropology,” said McNulty. “These two studies highlight the importance of extending collaboration and dialog beyond our immediate research partners.”References:“Oldest evidence of abundant C 4 grasses and habitat heterogeneity in eastern Africa” by Daniel J.

                            "summary": "A rare Hybrid Solar Eclipse or Surya Grahan falls on April 20 this year. On this day, the new moon will block the sun causing a Hybrid Solar Eclipse. During this remarkable event, the Eclipse shifts from Total Solar Eclipse to an Annular (ring-shaped) Eclipse because the moon's shadow moves across the earth's surface. This occurrence takes place only a few times throughout the centuries. According to Space.com, the last Hybrid Solar Eclipse occurred in 2013, and the next will occur in 2031. After that, Future skywatchers will have to wait until March 23, 2164, to see the next Hybrid Solar Eclipse. Additionally, Eid-Ul-Fitr will fall on April 20 with the occurrence of the new moon. Thus, the rare celestial event will coincide with Eid-Ul-Fitr, which has delighted sky gazers across the globe. Hybrid Solar Eclipse of April 20, 2023, will be visible from the South Pacific, but not India. (File Photo)When and where to watch Solar Eclipse?The rare Hybrid Solar Eclipse will not be visible in India. However, it will be visible from the South Pacific, with the moon's shadow passing over western Australia, East Timor and Indonesia beginning at 9:36 pm EDT on April 19 (1:36 GMT on April 20) and ending at 2:59 am EDT (6:59 GMT) the next day, according to In The Sky.Additionally, only two locations will witness the Eclipse transition from Annular to Total before transitioning back to Annular. However, these locations are unfortunately in the middle of the ocean.Totality will occur in the following locations:Western Australia: 10:29 pm to 10:35 pm EDT on April 19 (2:29 to 2:35 GMT, April 20)East Timor: 11:19 pm to 11:22 pm EDT on April 19 (3:19 to 3:22 GMT, April 20)Indonesia: 11:23 pm to 11:58 pm EDT on April 19 (3:23 to 3:58 GMT, April 20)If the path of the Eclipse doesn't pass over your location, you can still watch it on multiple free live streams - TimeAndDate.com and Gravity Discovery Centre & Observatory YouTube channels.What are Total, Annular, Partial and Hybrid Solar Eclipse?A Solar Eclipse occurs when the sun, moon and earth align fully or partially. A Surya Grahan has four types depending on how the sun, moon and earth line up - Total, Annular, Partial and Hybrid Solar Eclipse. According to NASA, a Total Solar Eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth and completely blocks the sun.An Annular (ring-shaped) Solar Eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and earth while being at the farthest point from earth. Because the moon is farther away from earth, it appears smaller than the sun and does not completely cover it.A Hybrid Solar Eclipse is the rarest of all solar eclipses. As per NASA, because the earth's surface is curved, sometimes an Eclipse can shift between the Annular and Total phases as the moon's shadow moves across the globe."

                            "summary": "A rare hybrid solar eclipse will occur on Thursday, creating total darkness and then a 'ring of fire' effect. A solar eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, partially blocking the Sun's rays and creating a shadow on the Earth's surface.After complete darkness for over a minute, there will be an annular eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun but the Moon appears smaller than the Sun in the sky. As a result, when the Moon crosses the path of the Sun, it does not completely cover the solar disk, leaving a ring of the Sun's outer edges visible around the Moon. This creates a spectacular ring of fire effect around the dark silhouette of the Moon.Hybrid solar eclipse: When and where will it be visible?America's space agency NASA said that on April 20, the Moon will pass between the Sun and Earth, creating a total solar eclipse visible from Australia and Southeast Asia. It will also be visible from the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Antarctica. Ningaloo, situated on Western Australia's coral coast, will be one of the best locations in the world to see it happen, according to the government of Western Australia.The eclipse will be visible from 1:34:26 (UTC Time) to 06:59:22. The first location will see the partial eclipse at 01:34:26 (which is 7:04:26 in Delhi), the full eclipse will be visible from 02:37:08 (08:07:08 in Delhi) and the maximum eclipse will be seen at 9:46:53. Last location will see the full eclipse at 5:56:43 (which is 11:26:43 in Delhi).Australia's Exmouth, a small resort town, will experience total darkness for 62 seconds as the moon’s shadow crosses the Exmouth Peninsula. The Moon’s transit across the Sun will take around three hours. During totality, some stars and planets become visible, the air temperature drops, and animals may change their behaviour.The sky will become dark and a bright corona will become visible around the moon created by the hot gases in the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere. In ordinary daylight, the corona of the Sun isn't visible but it can be seen during a total solar eclipse and looks like a white halo."

Similarly, the first lunar eclipse will occur on May 16, while the other on November 08. Traditional beliefs linked with Surya Grahan , say that pregnant women should not step out during Surya Grahan . Solar eclipses are thought to be harmful for pregnancy, according to ancient beliefs and astrology. Women who are expecting are advised to stay indoors during the solar eclipse.Dos and don'ts for pregnant women during the eclipse1. It is advised that pregnant women should remain indoors throughout the entire duration of a solar eclipse, as going outside during this time may potentially impact both the mother and the unborn child. According to traditional beliefs, even the eclipse’s shadow should be prevented from touching the unborn child.2. Pregnant women shouldn’t watch the solar eclipse, directly or indirectly. Doing this can hurt their eyes and overall health.3. During an eclipse, it is recommended to . During an eclipse, it is recommended to avoid consuming any food, as it is believed that the negative effects of the eclipse can contaminate it. However, if one experiences hunger pangs, it is suggested to consume thoroughly washed fruits.4. Pregnant women should also avoid sleeping during the duration of a solar eclipse.5. They should not use sharp objects like needles, scissors, knives, etc. as it is believed that doing this can have harmful physical effects on the unborn child.6. Do not use knife or any other sharp weapon at home during Grahan. Belief has it that cutting fruits and vegetables during Grahan Kaal will lead to the birth of a child with cleft organ.7. Avoid wearing metals especially sari pins, hair pin, tightening pins and jewelry etc.8. Some scriptures suggest that women should sit only on a bed with Durva Grass and chant the Santana Gopala Mantra.Though scientists argue there is no solid ground in such beliefs, pregnant woman for years have found faith in these precautions. The scientific argument that is easiest to give in favour of these precautions listed above is that, since Grahan is a phase that is anti the normal course of natural happenings, it's bound to have ill-effects. The extent of harm caused is debatable no doubt, especially in the absence of any research or facts to support the claims made by astrologers."

According to NASA, a solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Moon, and Earth line up, either fully or partially. Depending on how they align, eclipses provide a unique, exciting view of either the Sun or the Moon. However, not all eclipses are visible all over the globe. NASA released a map citing details of 2023 and 2024 solar eclipses in the United States.Today's NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day is the map of the total solar eclipse path which will take place on April 8 next year. Viewers in locations outside the paths will not experience a total solar eclipse or annular eclipse, but they may still see a partial eclipse. Apart from the hybrid solar eclipse occurring on April 20, an annular solar eclipse will also take place on October 14, while a total solar eclipse will happen on April 8, 2024. Lines running parallel to each path indicate how much of the Sun will become covered by the Moon during the partial eclipse. For the annular eclipse, these lines appear faint yellow. For the total eclipse, they're faint purple.The picture was created by NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS) which allows science enthusiasts to learn about NASA programs through visualization. According to NASA, the SVS works closely with scientists in the creation of visualizations, animations, and images to promote a greater understanding of Earth and Space Science research activities at NASA and within the academic research community supported by NASA.NASA's description of the pictureWould you like to see a total eclipse of the Sun? If so, do any friends or relatives live near the path of next April's eclipse? If yes again, then you might want to arrange a well-timed visit. Next April 8, the path of a total solar eclipse will cross North America from western Mexico to eastern Canada, entering the USA in southern Texas and exiting in northern Maine.All of North America will experience the least a partial solar eclipse. Featured here is a map of the path of totality. Many people who have seen a total solar eclipse tell stories about it for the rest of their lives. As a warmup, an annular solar eclipse will be visible later this year -- in mid-October."

                            "summary": "SAN FRANCISCO: SpaceX is all set to attempt the debut launch of the next generation Starship on Monday. However, CEO Elon Musk has lowered expectations for the inaugural launch.Starship is currently sitting on a launch pad at the company's facilities on the southern Texas coastline. The launch is targeted at 8 a.m. CT (6.30 p.m. IST) on Monday.I guess I'd like to just set expectations low,  Elon Musk said during a Twitter 'Spaces' event for his subscribers on Sunday.If we get far enough away from the launch pad before something goes wrong, then I think I would consider that to be a success. Just don't blow up the pad.There's a good chance that it gets postponed since we're going to be pretty careful about this launch,  he added.Musk had previously said that there is only a 50 per cent chance that the first-ever orbital mission of SpaceX's huge Starship vehicle will be a success. But he also stressed that SpaceX is building multiple Starship vehicles at the South Texas site.These will be launched in relatively quick succession over the coming months, and there's about an 80 per cent chance one of them will reach orbit this year.The test flight will be SpaceX's first attempt to launch a fully assembled Starship vehicle, building on a years-long testing campaign.It will not complete a full orbit around Earth. If successful, however, it will travel about 150 miles above Earth's surface, well into altitudes deemed to be outer space.With a test such as this, success is measured by how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,  the company wrote on its website.Starship is a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.It consists of a giant first-stage booster called Super Heavy and a 50 metres upper-stage spacecraft known as Starship. Both stainless-steel vehicles are designed to be fully and rapidly reusable, and both are powered by SpaceX's next-gen Raptor engine -- 33 for Super Heavy and six for Starship."

It's the biggest and mightiest rocket ever built, with the lofty goals of ferrying people to the moon and Mars.Jutting almost 400 feet (120 metres) into the South Texas sky, Starship could blast off as early as Monday, with no one aboard. Musk's company got the OK from the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday.It will be the first launch with Starship's two sections together. Early versions of the sci-fi-looking upper stage rocketed several miles into the stratosphere a few years back, crashing four times before finally landing upright in 2021.The towering first-stage rocket booster, dubbed Super Heavy, will soar for the first time.For this demo, SpaceX won't attempt any landings of the rocket or the spacecraft. Everything will fall into the sea.I'm not saying it will get to orbit, but I am guaranteeing excitement. It won't be boring, Musk promised at a Morgan Stanley conference last month. I think it's got, I don't know, hopefully about a 50 per cent chance of reaching orbit.Here's the rundown on Starship's debut:The stainless steel Starship has 33 main engines and 16.7 million pounds of thrust. All but two of the methane-fuelled, first-stage engines ignited during a launch pad test in January - good enough to reach orbit, Musk noted.Given its muscle, Starship could lift as much as 250 tons and accommodate 100 people on a trip to Mars. The six-engine spacecraft accounts for 164 feet (50 metres) of its height.Musk anticipates using Starship to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit, including his own Starlinks for internet service, before strapping anyone in. Starship easily eclipses NASA's moon rockets - the Saturn V from the bygone Apollo era and the Space Launch System from the Artemis programme that logged its first lunar trip late last year.It also outflanks the former Soviet Union's N1 moon rocket, which never made it past a minute into flight, exploding with no one aboard.The test flight will last 1 12 hours, and fall short of a full orbit of Earth. If Starship reaches the three-minute mark after launch, the booster will be commanded to separate and fall into the Gulf of Mexico.The spacecraft would continue eastward, passing over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans before ditching near Hawaii.Starship is designed to be fully reusable but nothing will be saved from the test flight. Harvard astrophysicist and spacecraft tracker Jonathan McDowell will be more excited whenever Starship actually lands and returns intact from orbit.It will be a profound development in spaceflight if and when Starship is debugged and operational, he said.Starship will take off from a remote site on the southernmost tip of Texas near Boca Chica Beach. It's just below South Padre Island, and about 20 miles from Brownsville.Down the road from the launch pad is the complex where SpaceX has been developing and building Starship prototypes for the past several years.The complex, called Starbase , has more than 1,800 employees, who live in Brownsville or elsewhere in the Rio Grande Valley.The Texas launch pad is equipped with giant robotic arms - called chopsticks - to eventually grab a returning booster as it lands. SpaceX is retooling one of its two Florida launch pads to accommodate Starships down the road.Florida is where SpaceX's Falcon rockets blast off with crew, space station cargo and satellites for NASA and other customers.As usual, Musk is remarkably blunt about his chances, giving even odds, at best, that Starship will reach orbit on its first flight. But with a fleet of Starships under construction at Starbase, he estimates an 80 per cent chance that one of them will attain orbit by year's end.He expects it will take a couple years to achieve full and rapid reusability.With Starship, the California-based SpaceX is focusing on the moon for now, with a USD 3 billion NASA contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface as early as 2025, using the upper stage spacecraft.It will be the first moon landing by astronauts in more than 50 years. The moonwalkers will leave Earth via NASA's Orion capsule and Space Launch System rocket, and then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the descent to the surface, and then back to Orion.To reach the moon and beyond, Starship will first need to refuel in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX envisions an orbiting depot with window-less Starships as tankers. But Starship isn't just for NASA.A private crew will be the first to fly Starship, orbiting Earth. Two private flights to the moon would follow - no landings, just flyarounds.There are other new rockets on the horizon. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is readying the New Glenn rocket for its orbital debut from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the next year or so.Named after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn, the rocket towers over the company's current New Shepard rocket, named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard's 1961 suborbital hop.NASA will use New Glenn to send a pair of spacecraft to Mars in 2024. United Launch Alliance expects its new Vulcan rocket to make its inaugural launch later this year, hoisting a private lunar lander to the moon at NASA's behest.Europe's Arianespace is close to launching its new, upgraded Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana in South America. And NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket that will carry astronauts will morph into ever bigger versions."

Here's why.Spotted: @ESA_JUICE on it's way to Jupiter! I managed to capture a sequence of images of the JUICE spacecraft that launched today using our @PirateOU telescopes in Tenerife. @OU_SPS @OpenUniversity @esaoperations #JUICE #ESA #Telescopes pic.twitter.comQHAYCZfkjkApril 15, 2023 See moreFrom a (very) rough calibration of the data last night it seems it was getting fainter by about 4.9 magnitudes per day, Jackson said. Going to try to spot it again tonight but since it’ll be roughly 100 times fainter, it might be hard to spot as clearly!Citizen scientist Petri Kuossari also spotted the JUICE spacecraft, this time from Finland, and also captured the second stage of the Ariane 5 rocket which carried the craft to space. The image was shared by SETI Institute astronomer Frank Marchis on his Twitter feed (opens in new tab).Juice and Ariane launch vehicle observed by Petri Kuossari from Finland with his @unistellar eVscope. pic.twitter.comsotr27yMWMApril 16, 2023 See moreTwitter user Guillet Bruno also caught a glimpse of the JUICE spacecraft heading away from Earth, bidding the mission bon voyage.Have a nice journey #JUICE to Ganymede, Callisto, Europa and Jupiter. See you during your next 🌍🌜 flyby in august 2024, Bruno said in the tweet (opens in new tab).As noted by Bruno, space enthusiasts and astronomers will get another chance to spot JUICE close to Earth when it approaches our planet for a gravity assist in August 2024. At that time, the ESA spacecraft will perform the first-ever gravity assist using at the same time the gravitational forces of Earth and its moon to alter the spacecraft's orbit.Have a nice journey #JUICE to Ganymede, Callisto, Europa and Jupiter. See you during your next 🌍🌜 flyby in august 2024 🛰@ESA_JUICE @Unistellar #evscope #DestinationJupiter pic.twitter.comhn6Z0A3Pf9April 15, 2023 See moreAfter this lunar-Earth gravity assist, JUICE will head toward Venus, the second planet from the sun for another gravity assist in 2025. After that, it will visit Earth twice more, in 2026 and 2029, to get additional energy boosts, offering additional opportunities to astronomers of varying skill levels to catch it.After the 2029 Earth flyby, JUICE will finally head toward Jupiter and three of its four largest moons, Europa , Callisto and Ganymede (opens in new tab), also known as the Galilean moons, due to the fact they were discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in the 1600s.The primary mission of JUICE will be to investigate the subsurface oceans believed to dwell beneath the icy shells of these Jovian moons. This could help determine if any of these moons possess the conditions needed to support life."

                            "summary": "The time it takes to get to Jupiter depends on a variety of factors, including planetary position and available technology.If you wanted to travel to Jupiter, how long would it take? The answer depends on a number of factors ranging from the positions of Earth and Jupiter to the technology that would propel you there.Here we take a look at how long a trip to Jupiter would take using available technology and explore the travel times of previous missions to the Jovian neighborhood.Currently, the spacecraft that took the shortest amount of time to reach Jupiter was NASA's New Horizons , zipping over to the gas giant in 405 days, or 1 year, 1 month and 9 days for a 2007 flyby.Related: Jupiter missions: Past, present and futureHow far away is Jupiter?To determine how long it would take to reach Jupiter, we must first know the distance between Earth and the gas giant.Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun but the distance between Earth and Jupiter is constantly changing as they orbit the sun in elliptical, or oval-shaped paths.When the two planets are at their closest point to one another, the distance to Jupiter is 365 million miles (588 million kilometers). The average distance between Earth and Jupiter is 444 million miles (714 million km), according to the science communication site The Nine Planets . At the farthest point in its orbit, the gas giant lies 601 million miles (968 million km) away.How long would it take to travel to Jupiter at the speed of light?Light travels at approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km per second). Therefore, a light shining from Jupiter would take the following amount of time to reach Earth (or vice versa):Closest approach: 33 minutesFarthest approach: 54 minutesAverage distance: 40 minutesFastest spacecraft so farNASA' Parker Solar Probe is currently studying the sun. (Image credit: Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory)(opens in new tab)The fastest spacecraft is NASA's Parker Solar Probe, which keeps breaking its own speed records as it moves closer to the sun . On Nov 21, 2021, the Parker Solar Probe reached a top speed of 101 miles (163 kilometers) per second during its 10th close flyby of our star, which translates to an eye-watering 364,621 mph (586,000 kph). According to a NASA statement (opens in new tab), when the Parker Solar Probe comes within 4 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the solar surface in December 2024, the spacecraft's speed will top 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kmh)!So if you were theoretically able to hitch a ride on the Parker Solar Probe and take it on a detour from its sun-focused mission to travel in a straight line out to Jupiter, traveling at the speeds the probe reaches during its 10th flyby (101 miles per second), the time it would take you to get to Jupiter would be:Closest approach: 42 daysFarthest approach: 69 daysAverage distance: 51 daysThe problems with calculating travel times to JupiterOf course, the problem with the previous calculations is that they measure the distance between the two planets as a straight line. If you were to travel between Earth and Jupiter when they are at their farthest distance apart, the trip would involve a path directly through the sun; therefore any spacecraft would have to move in orbit around the solar system's star.Although this isn't a problem for a trip made during the two planets' closest approach, when they are both on the same side of the sun, the trip is not without complications. The previously calculated travel times also assume that the two planets remain at a constant distance; that is, when a probe is launched from Earth while the two planets are at their closest approach, Jupiter would remain the same distance away over the period of time it takes the probe to reach the gas giant.In reality, however, the planets are moving at different rates during their orbits around the sun. Engineers must calculate the ideal orbits for sending a spacecraft from Earth to Jupiter. Like throwing a dart at a moving target from a moving vehicle, they must calculate where the planet will be when the spacecraft arrives, not where it is when it leaves Earth.It's also not feasible to travel as fast as you can possibly go if your aim is to eventually orbit your target planet. Spacecraft need to arrive slowly enough to be able to perform orbit insertion maneuvers and not just zip straight past their destinations.Engineers' calculations factor in not only the distance needed to travel but also the fuel efficiency of each particular spacecraft. Long-distance trips use gravity assist maneuvers to slingshot a spacecraft past planetary bodies and steal some of a planet's or other body's momentum to give the spacecraft a helpful nudge towards their intended destination. NASA's Jupiter explorer Juno performed an Earth flyby two years after its launch in order to boost the spacecraft's speed so that it could reach the gas giant, according to NASA . ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission will receive three gravity assists from Earth and one from Venus before it reaches the Jovian neighborhood.How long do missions take to get to Jupiter?Missions that aim to orbit their destination have to arrive more slowly than those just zipping straight past.

JUICE lifted off atop an Ariane 5 rocket after missing its previous launch window on Thursday, 13 April due to poor weather conditions.The spacecraft is equipped with several cameras, including two mounted on its body for monitoring the deployment of various JUICE systems, such as the solar wings and antennas. These cameras are responsible for these initial selfies providing 1024 x 1024 pixel snapshots that are then processed with a slight color adjustment.Related: Europe's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer is unlikely to find life. Here's why.Europe's Jupiter-bound JUICE probe took these images of its own solar arrays shortly after launch. (Image credit: ESA)At the front of the spacecraft is the JUICE monitoring camera 1 (JMC1) which looks up diagonally to view part of the probe's solar arrays. This field of view will also be able to see the spacecraft's antennas once they are deployed.Also monitoring deployment for JUICE's ESA operating team is the JUICE monitoring camera 2 (JMC2 ). This camera sits at the top of the spacecraft and will capture images of the 52-foot (16-meter) long Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME) antenna.The primary mission of RIME, currently stowed and set to unfold in stages over the coming days, will be to probe beneath the icy shells of the Jovian moons Europa , Ganymede and Callisto . This will help researchers investigate the subsurface oceans believed to lurk beneath the icy surfaces of these large moons of Jupiter . The scientists will be looking to see if these moons could possibly have environments that could host life.Image 1 of 2 Europe's Jupiter explorer JUICE is fitted with monitoring cameras that will keep taking selfies throughout the spacecraft's eight-year voyage to Jupiter.

(Image credit: ESA)JUICE also has a scientific camera that the spacecraft will use to take high-resolution images of Jupiter and the icy moons when it reaches the Jovian system in 2031 after its eight-year journey .The monitoring cameras will be active throughout the JUICE mission, capturing images. This will include JUICE's return to our planet in August 2024 when it will get a gravity assist from the combined Earth-moon system, the first lunar-Earth gravity assist (LEGA) to be performed in the history of spaceflight.The cameras could also catch some impressive Venus images when JUICE gets a gravity assist from the second planet from the sun in 2025. Earth will get another visit from JUICE in 2026 when it gets its final gravity assist to direct it toward Jupiter's orbit.That means that space enthusiasts can look forward to incredible JUICE images for years to come."

But a new, somewhat maddening study is sure to put a dent in this confidence, as it suggests the chances of a destructive asteroid colliding with the Earth might be much higher than previously believed!The findings came to light when James Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, presented his work last week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.Garvin and his colleagues used high-resolution satellite imagery to identify large rings around three impact craters and one probable impact crater that are 1 million years old or younger. This timeframe was selected because the past 1 million years have some of the best-preserved history of near-Earth object impact events, in terms of deposits and associated crater landform features.Garvin believed the rings represented craters tens of kilometres wide, meaning the asteroid-striking events must've been far more violent than the craters itself suggested. And we're talking ten times more violent than the largest nuclear bomb in history, more than enough to blow a part of the Earth's atmosphere into space.While these couldn't have been as destructive as the asteroid strike that led to the dino extinction, they would've been sufficient to disturb the global climate and cause local extinctions.Or, as Garvin articulated it: It would be in the range of serious crap happening.The team calculated impact rates by tallying crater sizes and ages on the Moon since water and wind are quick to erase most, if not all, signs of impact craters on Earth. They also looked into the dimensions of the asteroids that hang around Earth since these could potentially hit our planet.Advertisement And based on these two parameters, Garvin and his team have found that a 1-kilometre-wide or larger asteroid or comet strikes Earth every 600,000 to 700,000 years.This would mean that in the past million years alone, four 1 km-wide objects pummeled the continents. With two-thirds of the planet being covered by water, that would equate to nearly a dozen such asteroids striking Earth in that time frame.However, there's quite a bit of scepticism surrounding the study, with the authors themselves claiming that more fieldwork is required to back up the conclusions.Anna Łosiak, a crater researcher at the Polish Academy of Sciences, doubts the ringlike features identified by Garvin's team are truly crater rims. If they somehow are, she says: That would be very scary because it would mean we really don't understand what's going on at all — and that there are a lot of space rocks that may come and make a mess.There could be some truth to Garvin's hypothesis, making it imperative for researchers to conduct further analyses — whether to prove or disprove the theory. In the future, the team will have to gather more evidence by visiting sites of the rings to look for the deformed rocks and gravitational variations that would indicate an actual crater rim.**​For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

Researchers and scientists are keeping a close eye on each and every object possible to collect some new information. Similarly, scientists also track objects which can be dangerous for planet Earth. One such object is an asteroid. NASA, via Jet Propulsion Laboratory also informs about the asteroids that are zooming towards the planet. And as per the latest details, a 250-foot giant rock is on its way to Earth. Here is all you need to know.250-foot asteroid 2020 BV14The massive 250-foot asteroid named 2020 BV14 is all set to fly past planet Earth on Sunday, April 16. According to the details provided by NASA's JPL, this building-sized asteroid called 2020 BV14 will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 6.81 million kilometers and is travelling at a speed of 29376 kilometer per hour. Will it be dangerous? No. As per the current trajectory on which it is travelling, the asteroid will pass by the planet, albeit at very close quarters.However, NASA keeps on tracking these asteroids to ensure that, if due to any reason, the asteroids change their trajectory enough time may be obtained to send a warning to the public at large. In order to keep an eye on the asteroids and track their movement, NASA has deployed several Earth and Sky-based technologies like telescopes, satellites, and more.Asteroid factsDo you know that there are currently 1278661 known steroids, according to NASA? All these asteroids vary in their sizes with the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter to less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. Asteroids are classified under three categories- Main Asteroid Belt, Trojans, and Near Earth Asteroids. The near-Earth asteroids have orbits that pass close by that of Earth."

                            "summary": "Although asteroids make close approaches to Earth almost every day, most of them are not big enough to potentially wipe out life on the planet. In fact, an asteroid with a diameter of around 96 kilometers (about half the distance from Washington, D.C. to New York City) can actually completely extinguish life on Earth, but smaller asteroids can still cause harm. Despite being much smaller than that, NASA has issued a warning that a 350-foot wide asteroid is expected to make its closest approach to Earth today.Asteroid 2023 GM informationScientists are intrigued by Asteroid 2023 GM, due to its colossal size. According to NASA, the asteroid is estimated to be roughly 350 feet wide, which is comparable in size to a towering skyscraper. Given its enormity, if Asteroid 2023 GM were to collide with the planet, it could cause immense destruction, particularly if it landed in a densely populated region.As per the space agency, Asteroid 2023 GM is set to reach its nearest distance to Earth today, April 17, at a distance of 3.2 million kilometers. While this distance may seem considerable, it's relatively minor in terms of astronomical measurements, considering the massive size of the asteroid.In fact, Asteroid 2023 GM is already dashing towards Earth, at a fiery speed of 72312 kilometers per hour!NASA tech used to study asteroidsNASA not only uses its space telescopes and observatories like the NEOWISE to observe and study distant asteroids, but also a variety of ground-based telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALMA) located in the Antofagasta Region of the Atacama Desert in Chile.NASA also has a new impact monitoring system in place which uses an algorithm called Sentry-II to calculate the impact risk of Near-Earth Objects. NASA can track the orbital path of the asteroid using this infrared data and can even predict its orbit years into the future. As of now, nearly 28,000 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered using various tech instruments which track objects in the sky."

                            "summary": "It has been almost a week since the last solar storm hit the Earth. And it was a relatively minor storm that did not really affect us much. The worst was experienced over the Indian Ocean region where a temporary radio blackout was observed. But things are about to change quickly for the worse. NASA has issued a warning over a major solar storm strike on Earth. The initial hit is expected tomorrow, April 19, when glancing blows are expected and on April 20, a massive direct hit has been predicted. If this solar storm does strike the Earth, the impact can be far more dangerous.The information comes from space weather physicist Tamitha Skov, who is popularly known as Space Weather Woman. In a recent tweet, she said, “Ready for #aurora? A #solarstorm direct hit is coming. NASA predicts impact 20 April. Additional glancing storms launched earlier mean activity could pick up late on April 19. Expect extended aurora at high latitudes with good chance of views down to mid-latitudes by the 20th”.Solar storm to strike over the next two daysThe source of this solar storm is a massive coronal mass ejection (CME) cloud that is headed for the Earth. The cloud is moving in a crescent shape and that is why glancing blows are expected earlier than a direct hit. However, this partial strike can have a concerning effect. It can weaken the magnetic fields of the Earth enough to create cracks on it, which can allow CME to escape into the upper atmosphere and cause a far more intense storm.Apart from this, Skov has also revealed in her weekly forecast that there is a 10 percent chance for an X-class solar flare eruption on Sun. Such eruptions are the biggest reason behind shortwave radio blackouts and GPS disruption. If such an eruption does take place and it coincides with the solar storm, the overall impact can get more complicated.A solar storm like that today can be quite terrifying. It can disrupt GPS, hamper mobile networks and the internet, and even cause a massive power outage by corrupting the power grids. Even the electronic devices on Earth are not safe from malfunctioning.The role of the NASA Solar Dynamics ObservatoryThe NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) carries a full suite of instruments to observe the Sun and has been doing so since 2010. It uses three very crucial instruments to collect data from various solar activities. They include Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) which takes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible solar disk, Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) which measures the Sun's extreme ultraviolet irradiance and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) which provides continuous full-disk observations of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels."

                            "summary": "There is a solar flare coming that is likely to hit Earth, NOAA has revealed. Solar flares are spewed out by our Sun and can be several times larger than the Earth and cause significant damage through geomagnetic storms. To better understand these solar flares, researchers have successfully replicated them in a laboratory. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasters have alerted that there are chances of a solar flare today itself, SpaceWeather.com reported. The possibility of a solar flare is 40 percent and that too of an M-class intensity.AR3280, a rapidly developing sunspot, is probably the origin of the impending solar flare. It possesses a beta-gamma magnetic field that is unstable and has the potential for M-class solar flares. Solar flares are categorized into A, B, C, M, and X classes according to their strength. An X-class solar flare is considered the strongest, while an M-class solar flare is the second most powerful.Active regions on the Sun, usually characterized by sunspot groups and strong magnetic fields, are the typical sites for solar flares. As these magnetic fields undergo changes, they can become unstable and discharge energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as solar flares.Impact of Solar Slare on EarthThe worrying part is that the sunspot is almost directly facing Earth, SpaceWeather.com added in its report. What effect will it have on Earth? Although Earth's magnetosphere is effective in blocking solar flares, some charged particles manage to penetrate through. These high-energy particles can result in magnetic disruptions referred to as geomagnetic storms or substorms, which can give rise to beautiful auroras, also known as the Northern Lights.When solar particles collide with Earth, they can interfere with radio communications and the power grid by impacting the planet's magnetic field. These effects can lead to power and radio blackouts lasting from a few hours to several days. However, electricity grid complications are rare and only occur during major solar flares.Tech behind solar flare predictionsThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitors Solar Flares and Sun's behaviour using its DSCOVR satellite which became operational in 2016. The recovered data is then run through the Space Weather Prediction Center and the final analysis is prepared. The satellite tracks different measurements of the Sun and its atmospheres such as temperature, speed, density, degree of orientation, and frequency of the solar particles."

                            "summary": "Remember the film 2012 which showed the end of the world, as predicted by the ancient Mayan civilisation thousands of years ago? The film's plot was based on the Sun releasing unstable neutrinos due to unusual energy processes in the Sun which were heating up Earth's core. Although this might seem like a terrifying scenario, the science behind the film was questionable. But the threat posed by the Sun is very true. Forecasters have recently discovered multiple sunspots on the solar surface which could hurl dangerous solar flares towards Earth.Solar flare riskAccording to a report by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), multiple sunspots, named AR3280 and AR3281, have been observed in the solar regions. These sunspots are dangerous as they currently have unstable 'beta-gamma' magnetic fields. Although this solar activity might seem harmless due to the distance of the Sun from our planet, they can cause major damage. Because of the unstable nature of these sunspots, there is a chance of M-class solar flares.According to NASA, Sunspots are dark areas on the solar surface which contain strong magnetic fields that are constantly shifting and can form and dissipate over periods of days or weeks. As solar flares travel out directly from the flare site, if we can see the flare, we can be impacted by it.How are solar flares rated?According to NASA, solar flares are classified according to their strength on the logarithmic scale, similar to how earthquakes are measured. The smallest ones are A-class which occur at near background levels, followed by B, C, M and X. Similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, each letter represents a 10-fold increase in energy output. So an X is ten times an M and 100 times a C. Within each letter class there is a finer scale from 1 to 9.Solar observation techWhile many space agencies from NASA with its Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) keep track of Sun-based weather phenomena, one that particularly stands out is the DSCOVR satellite by NOAA. The satellite became operational in 2016 and tracks different measurements of the Sun and its atmosphere including temperature, speed, density, degree of orientation and frequency of the solar particles. The recovered data is then run through the Space Weather Prediction Center and the final analysis is prepared."

File Photo courtesy of NASAApril 18 (UPI) -- Two Russian astronauts will make their third attempt at a spacewalk Tuesday night, where they will move a radiator and an experiment module. The six-hour and 40-minute excursion by International Space Station Expedition 69 cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin will begin at 9:30 p.m. EDT. AdvertisementThe pair will be moving a radiator from the Rassvet module to the Nauka science module.Cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev will assist with robotic activities from inside the ISS using the European Space Agency's robotic arm, NASA said in a blog post.Prokopyev and Petelin have already made two attempts at a spacewalk. However, an attempt in November had to be aborted because of a failed spacesuit pump. Then in December, a Russian Soyuz spacecraft suffered a coolant leak, forcing the attempt to be called off again.NASA said Tuesday that the pair was getting a good night's sleep while the rest of the ISS crew continued cleaning biology research hardware, conducted an eye and brain study, and serviced a pair of spacesuits.NASA Flight Engineers Frank Rubio and Stephen Bowen worked together Tuesday cleaning up the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) located in the Kibo laboratory module, the agency said.AdvertisementAfter Tuesday's walk, the pair are scheduled for two more excursions on April 25 and May 4."

The rest of the Expedition 69 crew is cleaning up following the departure of a U.S. cargo craft while also working on a pair of Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs), or spacesuits.Commander Sergey Prokopyev and Flight Engineer Dmitri Petelin are set to begin their second spacewalk together at 9:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. The duo spent Monday reviewing the tasks required to move a radiator from the Rassvet module to the Nauka science module during the planned six-hour and 40-minute excursion. Prokopyev and Petelin also set up their spacewalking tools, installed components on their Orlan spacesuits, and organized the Poisk module’s airlock where they will exit the station.Roscosmos Flight Engineer Andrey Fedyaev will assist the spacewalkers in and out of their spacesuits on Tuesday and command the European robotic arm to maneuver the radiator and attach it to Nauka. NASA TV begins its live spacewalk coverage at 9 p.m. on Tuesday on the agency’s app and website.Two NASA Flight Engineers spent Monday cleaning up after the SpaceX Dragon cargo craft departed the orbital outpost on Saturday returning 4,300 pounds of science experiments and station hardware back to Earth for analysis. Astronauts Woody Hoburg and Frank Rubio cleaned and stowed biology hardware housing samples that were shipped back to Earth aboard Dragon. Those samples and others will now be examined by scientists to understand how the human body adapts to living and working in weightlessness.The NASA duo also partnered up with UAE (United Arab Emirates) astronaut Sultan Alneyadi loading another U.S. resupply ship ahead of its departure at the end of the week. The three flight engineers are packing trash and other discarded gear inside the Northrop Grumman Cygnus space freighter before it leaves the station later this week. Alneyadi will be on duty that morning monitoring Cygnus as mission controllers on the ground command the Canadarm2 robotic arm to release the spacecraft from the Unity module’s Earth-facing port. Cygnus will then reenter Earth’s atmosphere above the Pacific Ocean for a fiery, but safe demise.Finally, Alneyadi and NASA Flight Engineer Stephen Bowen worked together resizing a pair of EMUs in the Quest airlock. The two astronauts are getting the U.S. spacesuits ready for an upcoming spacewalk to continue upgrading the station’s power generation capability.Learn more about station activities by following the space station blog, @space_station and @ISS_Research on Twitter, as well as the ISS Facebook and ISS Instagram accounts.Get weekly video highlights at: https:roundupreads.jsc.nasa.govvideupdateGet the latest from NASA delivered every week.

The foursome split its time throughout the day maintaining science hardware, studying how microgravity affects their eyes and brain, and cleaning spacesuits.NASA Flight Engineers Frank Rubio and Stephen Bowen worked together Tuesday cleaning up the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) located in the Kibo laboratory module. The CBEF housed biological samples that were returned to Earth inside the SpaceX Dragon cargo craft several hours after it undocked from the station at 11:05 a.m. Saturday. Those samples and more will be analyzed by scientists on Earth to continue learning how living in weightlessness affects the human body.Rubio later checked out the KERMIT fluorescence microscope that supports biology, physics, and materials research. Bowen joined NASA Flight Engineer Woody Hoburg at the end of the day for eye exams that are part of the ISAFE study that measures eye, brain, and blood vessel changes in space.Hoburg began his day checking cooling loops and collecting water samples from inside an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), or spacesuit. UAE (United Arab Emirates) Flight Engineer Sultan Alneyadi continued the EMU maintenance as he recharged and filled water tanks in the suits.

                            "summary": "UNITED STATES: NASA has shared a stunning image of a galaxy that shines brighter than the light of a trillion suns. The image was captured by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, and it shows a “snowflake-like” object with a bright white core and eight pinkish-orange spikes. This so-called “snowflake” is actually two galaxies that are colliding and merging.Arp 220 is a galaxy that may be found in the Serpens constellation, 250 million light-years away. With a total brilliance of more than a trillion suns, it is actually two spiral galaxies that are merging. In contrast, the illumination of our Milky Way galaxy is much more modest—roughly the equivalent of ten billion suns.- Advertisement -The closest of the three galactic mergers closest to Earth, Arp 220, is the brightest and nearest ULIRG (ultra-luminous infrared galaxy). The Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies by Halton Arp lists it as the 220th item.According to NASA, this galactic collision, which started around 700 million years ago, caused a massive explosion of star creation. Webb’s infrared vision allows it to see through the dust that obscures the star formation’s light.- Advertisement -With its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the James Webb Space Telescope saw Arp 220. These devices enable the telescope to take sharp pictures of the galaxy by allowing it to see through the dust.The image that Webb captured is not only beautiful but also useful scientifically. By studying galaxies like Arp 220, astronomers can learn more about the processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution.- Advertisement -The collision of two galaxies can cause a massive burst of star formation, as seen in Arp 220. This star formation can also trigger the growth of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. By studying the properties of these black holes, astronomers can learn more about the evolution of galaxies over time.In summary, the image of Arp 220 captured by NASA’s Webb Telescope is a remarkable sight that showcases the beauty and complexity of the universe. It also provides valuable scientific insights into the processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope later this year is eagerly anticipated, and we can’t wait to see what new discoveries it will uncover.Also Read: NASA’s IXPE Satellite Produces Detailed Map of Magnetic Fields in Crab Nebula"

The telescope recently captured a celestial spectacle named Arp 220-- an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), that shines with light equal to more than a trillion suns.Sharing the image, NASA Webb wrote, ''We love this with the fire of a trillion suns. Shown here is Arp 220, an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) with a luminosity literally greater than that of a trillion suns. (It emits 300 times more light than the Milky Way!) Arp 220 glows brightest in infrared light, Webb's speciality.''See the image here:Describing the image, NASA Webb Telescope wrote, ''A black, deep space image is dominated by a large central object. This object resembles a snowflake-like feature with a bright white core and 8 pinkish-orange spikes. In reality, this “snowflake” is actually two colliding galaxies with merging cores. The brilliant light from the star formation surrounding these cores creates diffraction spikes, an optical effect that occurs when bright light interacts with a telescope's optics. The background is punctuated with scattered red, white and orange galaxies of various shapes and sizes.''Arp 220 is actually two spiral galaxies in the process of merging, with a combined luminosity exceeding a trillion suns. In comparison, our Milky Way galaxy has a much more modest luminosity of about ten billion suns. Located 250 million light-years away in the Serpens constellation, Arp 220 is the nearest ULIRG and the brightest of the three galactic mergers closest to Earth. It is also the 220th object listed in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.According to NASA, an enormous burst of star formation was triggered by this galactic collision that commenced roughly 700 million years ago.''This object is the result of a collision between 2 spiral galaxies that began about 700 million years ago, sparking a huge burst of star formation.

(Image credit: Image: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Image processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI))We won't be around to watch our Milky Way galaxy fuse with its closest neighbor, Andromeda, a few billion years from now. But we're getting a spectacular front-row seat to another galactic merger, thanks to NASA's powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb).A newly released JWST photo captures two galaxies collectively called Arp 220, which are now merging 250 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Serpens (the Serpent).Galaxy mergers unfold for a long time, even on cosmic timescales. Astronomers think the galaxies of Arp 220, which are spirals like the Milky Way and have similar tails swirling in their outskirts, began blending 700 million years ago. (For reference, the Milky Way galaxy will closely approach Andromeda in the next four to five billion years, and the merger itself will span 10 billion years.)Related: James Webb Space Telescope: Everything you need to knowWhen Arp 220's galaxies began merging, the abundant gas and dust triggered intense star formation, and most of it was concentrated in their dusty central regions. The amount of gas in this tiny region is equal to all of the gas in the entire Milky Way galaxy, Webb team members wrote in an image description (opens in new tab) published on Monday (April 17).Over 200 star clusters are packed in an area just 5,000 light-years across, astronomers say. Arp 220's central star-forming ring shines brilliantly, its light seen as six spikes ejecting out in Webb's image.Webb isn't the first to eye Arp 220. Pictures clicked by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 2002 were key to spotting the cores of Arp 220's galaxies. The space agency's Chandra X-Ray Observatory also has observed Arp 220, and has recorded X-rays blasting out from these centers, which are separated by 1,200 light-years . Chandra specializes in seeing massive and violent objects in the universe like black holes and supernovas, so astronomers think the X-rays hint at supermassive black holes residing at the centers of both galaxies.Astronomers previously thought that, like its central region, much of Arp 220 hosts heaps of star clusters, but recent research (opens in new tab) that analyzed Hubble's pictures found that star formation shut off suddenly everywhere about 100 million years ago, possibly as a consequence of the merger. It looks like Arp 220 is now in a post-starburst stage, which means it does not produce stars at extreme, short-lived rates, but is instead quiescent.To click this latest image, Webb used two high-tech instruments onboard: The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) — the telescope's primary camera — and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which can snap images as well as capture the light spectra of its targets. Both instruments were handy, as Arp 220 shines its brightest in infrared wavelengths. Indeed, the object's light is equivalent to more than a trillion suns, according to the image description. Our Milky Way's luminosity, by comparison, is about 10 billion suns, Webb team members said.Astronomers do not usually tag two merging galaxies with one name. Arp 220 is the 220th celestial object in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Published in 1966 by American astronomer Halton C. Arp, the catalog lists 338 uncommon galaxies whose shapes astronomers did not understand back then.A subset of the collection to which Arp 220 belongs includes galaxies that were neither spiral nor elliptical, and left an open question for future astronomers to dive into. Arp 220's jumbled shape was explained when they later found that it is not one but two galaxies coalescing."

Salman also sings this track titled Let's Dance Chotu Motu. He is accompanied by south composer Devi Sri Prasad aka DSP on the song. The rap portions of the new song are handled by Yo Yo Honey Singh and Neha Bhasin. DSP also contributes to the hookline lyrics of the song. (Also read: O Balle Balle: Salman Khan grooves to Punjabi beats of Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan song, creates new hook steps) Salman Khan's next film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan will be released on April 21.Like the other south-themed song Yentamma, this new track features Salman, Jassie Gill, Raghav Juyal, Venkatesh Daggubati and others dressed in veshtis as they dance around in a courtyard. The female actors including Pooja Hegde and Bhumika Chawla are also decked up in traditional outfits for the number. Honey Singh also appears with the cast in a few segments of the song.Salman goes through nursery rhymes like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Jack and Jill and Humpty Dumpty, but the song gives no indication as to why they are included in the number. As has been the custom with most Salman tracks, there is a hook step in this one as well. The nursery rhymes and the rap portions seem bizarrely pieced together and while the song is upbeat and catchy, it does not gel.Fans reacted to the combination of Salman and Honey Singh on this new song from Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. This song arrives just as the rapper-composer has shared the announcement of his new album, Honey 3.0. On YouTube, one fan wrote in the comments section, HONEY SINGH IS BACK. While another added, Salman Bhi × Yo Yo Honey Singh = Blockbuster Song. Others wrote about how the song will appeal to Salman's very young fans. One fan shared, This will going to be the kids anthem. As an adult I love it so u can imagine the craze in kids after hear this song. It's soo cute n sounds gd at same time.Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan is directed by Farhad Samji. It is said to be adapted from the Ajith-starrer Veeram. Besides Yentamma, O Balle Balle, Naiyo Lagda, Billi Billi, Jee Rahe The Hum (Falling in Love) and Bathukamma have also been previously released from the film. Produced by Salman's production banner, the Hindi film will release on April 21.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

                            "summary": "In the past few months, actor Parineeti Chopra's personal life has grabbed attention. She is reportedly dating Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha. There were also rumours about the two planning to tie the knot after they were spotted together at Delhi and Mumbai airports in recent weeks. Now, Parineeti has opened up about media speculation over her personal life. Also read: Parineeti Chopra blushes as paparazzi tease her amid Raghav Chadha engagement rumours Parineeti Chopra was spotted with Raghav Chadha in Mumbai recentlyIn a new interview, Parineeti said that there is a thin line between the media discussing her life and 'crossing the line by being too personal or disrespectful'. The actor said she would clarify only if this leads to misconception, adding if 'not necessary', she would avoid issuing any clarification about her life.When asked how does the actor fulfill her duty as a public figure, while also ensuring her personal life remains stable, Parineeti told Lifestyle Asia India, There is a thin line between the media discussing my life and sometimes crossing the line by being too personal or disrespectful. If that happens, I will clarify if there are any misconceptions. If it is not necessary to clarify, I won't.Recently, a lot has been said in media reports and on social media about Parineeti's frequent travels. The actor is often spotted at Mumbai airport in paparazzi videos. She also spoke about travelling frequently in the same interview. Parineeti said, “I would never sacrifice my life for work or work for my life. I always strive to maintain a balance between the two. I remember when I used to travel frequently and spend a lot of time at the airport, people would ask me where I was going and what I was doing, but they would never understand the fact that I was able to balance my life effectively. I think post Covid-19, a lot of people finally understood that.”Recently rumours of Parineeti and Raghav's engagement have been doing the rounds. Last month, AAP leader Sanjeev Arora had shared a congratulatory tweet for Raghav and Parineeti, sparking rumours about their engagement. Amid wedding rumours, and some reports also claiming that their roka ceremony will take place soon, Parineeti was spotted in Mumbai on Monday. She was seen flaunting a silver band on her ring finger, and smiling as she posed for paparazzi.Parineeti Chopra was last seen in the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Uunchai. Next, she will be seen in Chamkila and Capsule Gill.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

While the two have stayed mum about their relationship, their frequent outings with each other have led fans to believe that the couple is indeed together. In a recent interview, Parineeti was asked how she handles the spotlight and media attention on her personal life and the actor said that she tries to look at it “positively”.Talking to Lifestyle Asia India, the actor said that she sees the “recognition, love, and acceptance” as “success”. “If I were nobody or they were not interested in me, that would probably mean that I did not achieve what I tried to achieve as an actor because a successful actor will be famous, will be a part of everybody’s homes, a part of living room conversation, a part of the news, a part of the news channels, a part of digital media, a part of the paparazzi culture, and everything,” she said.Parineeti Chopra, however, pointed out that “there is a thin line between them discussing my life and sometimes crossing the line into being too personal or disrespectful.” She said that in such cases, she would just “clarify” if anyone has gotten anything wrong. She said, “If that ever happens, I will just clarify in case somebody’s gotten anything wrong. So, I mean, if the world was not interested, I would have considered myself unsuccessful. If the world is interested, that means I’ve done something right in my career. So that’s how I see it.”The rumours about Parineeti and Raghav’s relationship first started after they were spotted outside a Mumbai restaurant a few times. The couple was then photographed when Parineeti traveled to Delhi and Raghav came to pick her up from the airport. In an earlier chat with NDTV, Raghav was asked about his relationship with the actor and he said, “I will tell you. We will have a separate interview on that.”"

The actress is leaving no stone unturned to allure her fans and moviegoers to the theatres during the movie promotions.Apart from gaining fame with Bigg Boss 13, Naaz remained in the headline for her romantic relationship with Sidharth Shukla. However, Sid’s sudden demise left everyone shocked and Naaz heartbroken. It certainly took a long time for her to step out of the trauma.Lately, fans urged Naaz to move on and get married to Guru Randhawa after the duo was seen romancing in Punjabi romantic song ‘Moon Rise.’ While Naaz and Guru’s on-and-off chemistry triggered the rumours, now, reports are abuzz that Raghav Juyal and Naaz are reportedly dating. Salman’s statement during an event set off the rumours.Meanwhile, Naaz is ready to move on in life and the actress has admitted to it.The entire team of Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan graced The Kapil Sharma Show for promotion of their upcoming.While Salman and Pooja Hegde were the first to come, Raghav and Shehnaaz entered the show after a while. Next, it was Jassie Gill and Palak Tiwari followed by Siddharth Nigam and Vinali Bhatnagar.During the intro session, when Kapil came to Naaz, he immediately came to his own style and started praising her. Next, Kapil went on to ask all others if Shehnaaz troubled others with her talkative nature on sets of Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. While Pooja said she didn’t trouble anyone, Salman went on to say that no one allowed her to get into her (talkative) mood.However, Raghav went on to say, “Ladki Bhayankar hai lekin yeh,” while all others were laughing.When Kapil out of surprise repeated, “Bhayankar,” Salman mocked Raghav and said, “Bhayankar hi bolega inko.”After that, Raghav went on to clarify, “Bhayankar matlab, actor achi hai, dancer achi hai, aur acha kaam kiya hai film mein, toh uss hisab se bhayankar.”A few moments later after an amusing session with Raghav and Palak, Kapil once again was back to Naaz.Kapil at first inquired if she has any payment on hold from her previous show with Salman for which she came to recover by working in film. To this Naaz replied, “Sabse saasti mein hi thi, aur sabse mehengi ban ke nikli hoon.”Later, when Kapil talked about being loved by boys, she said, “Toh achi baat hai, mujhe pyaar karo, mein hoon hi itni pyaari.” However, she fumbled and stopped which triggered a laugh riot.Next, she continued, “Sari duniya ko pyaar bantne ke liye hi toh hum bane hain. Toh sabko bantna chahiye pyaar.”However, Salman interrupted and said that Kapil is asking about a particular person.To this, Naaz instantly replied, “Haan, mein pyaar karne ke liye ready hoon. Mein move on karne ke liye bhi ready hoon. But ladka, jisko mein pyaar karungi bas wahi allowed hai.”“Arey woh ladka, jo tumko pyaar karega woh better hai,” said Salman. He continued, “Aisa ki tum usse pyaar karo, woh tumse pyaar nahi kare...”However, Naaz interrupted Salman and said, “Sir, aap galat ho yahan pe. Pyaar pehele mein karungi, Uske baad mein karwa loongi usse pyaar.”This statement impressed Salman as well as the audience."

The actor, who is busy promoting her first Bollywood film, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan, recalled in a new interview how the Punjabi film industry had ‘cut her off completely’. She revealed how she was not called for her own movie's premiere and that had hurt her the most. Also read: Shehnaaz Gill denies following Salman Khan's 'girls should be covered’ rule on Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan sets Shehnaaz Gill spoke about her struggles in a new interview.Shehnaaz said she cried after she was not invited to the premiere of her Punjabi film, even though she did not name which movie she was speaking of. Shehnaaz Gill made her Punjabi acting debut with Sat Shri Akaal England (2017). Since then she has worked in Punjabi films such as Kala Shah Kala, Daaka and Honsla Rakh.When asked to share her two struggling moments that she can never forget, Shehnaaz said in an interview to Siddharth Kannan, Ek baar maine ek movie pe kaam kiya tha second lead mein. And mujhe premiere pe bhi nahi bulaya tha, sari duniya ko bulaya tha, pura production house. Punjabi film thi. Main apni movie dekh kar nikli aur maine dekha sari photos and all ho rahi hain unki, premiere mein jo log the. Main uss din bahut royi gadi mein ja ke ki unhone mujhe call kiya, phir mujhe cancel kar diya. Mujhe tab bahut dukh hua tha ki mujhe nahi bulaya sab ko bulaya (For my Punjabi film's premiere, everyone was called, but not me. They asked me to come, and then cancelled. After watching the film, I saw the cast posing for photographers as I left the theater. I remember crying as I sat in my car, wondering why was I not called, when everyone else was).Shehnaaz also said, Struggle toh main bahut kiya hai. Punjabi industry ne bilkul hi mujhe cut-off kar diya tha. But woh kehte hain na 'Jiska koi nahi, uska bhagwan hota hai', toh mera bhagwan hai. Karma (I have struggled a lot. Punjabi film industry had cut me off completely. But as they say 'Those who have no one, have God'. I have God. It is all Karma).Shehnaaz, who appeared in Bigg Boss 13, is all set to make her Bollywood debut with Salman Khan-starrer Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. The action film also stars Bhumika Chawla, Pooja Hegde and Raghav Juyal, among others. Besides Shehnaaz, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan also marks the Bollywood debut of actor Shweta Tiwari's daughter Palak Tiwari. The film will be released in theatres on April 21.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

She took to her Instagram earlier today and shared a cryptic and philosophical post. The actress quoted the revered Sanskrit lines from Bhagavad Gita, “Karmanye vadhika raste Ma phaleshu kadachana Ma karma phala he tur bhuh Ma te sangotsva karmani (sic),” which translates to – “You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.”Samantha will move on to her next major project, Russo Brothers’ Amazon Prime original, Citadel, helmed by Raj and DK.

The line she quoted literally translates to ‘You have a right to perform your prescribed action, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your action’.

The timing of her post and the quote from the Gita hints that she’s not concerned by the performance of Shaakuntalam.Sharing a new picture, Samantha wrote a Sanskrit verse from the Gita. It read: “Karmanye vadhika raste Ma phaleshu kadachana Ma karma phala he tur bhuh Ma te sangotsva karmani (sic).” The translation reads, “You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.”Meanwhile, Shaakuntalam has turned out to be Samantha’s biggest failure. In its opening weekend globally, the Gunasekhar directorial, which was dubbed and released in Tamil as well as Hindi, didn’t even manage to gross ₹10 crore.Trade analyst Trinath had told HT that the film turned out to be a disaster at the box office with the lowest opening ever for a Samantha starrer. “Samantha’s films have always managed to register good to decent openings. Even her last release Yashoda, despite mixed reviews, opened strongly at the box-office. Shaakuntalam was rejected from the first show and after collecting around ₹5 crore on the first day worldwide, the film couldn’t recover at all. In the opening weekend, it didn’t even collect over ₹10 crore globally,” he said.In Shaakuntalam, Samantha plays the central character Shakuntala, daughter of Menaka and Viswamithra. The project marked her maiden collaboration with director Gunasekhar. It also stars Sachin Khedekar, Dev Mohan and Gautami in key roles.Samantha will be next seen in upcoming Telugu romantic drama Kushi, co-starring Vijay Deverakonda. She also has the Indian adaptation of Citadel with Varun Dhawan.ott:10SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

The first two episodes of the six-part series will premiere on April 28.In an interview with Extra TV, Priyanka spoke about kicking off the Citadel global tour in India. She said, “It was so sweet. It was very emotional for me that we kicked off this whole global tour in Mumbai. I was sitting right next to Richard and my mom and we're surrounded by friends and family and industry folk that have seen me since I was 18 years old. It was poignant and really emotional for me. Citadel is the sum of my 22 years in the business. It's everything that I have learnt and everything that I know. It's something I'm very proud of and hopefully people will enjoy the show as much as we enjoy it.”Opening up about her daughter's first visit to Mumbai, she added, It was Malti's first time in India. It was Malti's first time in Mumbai. She loves it. She loved everything about it, from the sights to the sounds, to the food... from going to her nani's house, which is my mom's house. She loved everything about it.The actor will be filming a feature in the UK called Heads of State with Idris Elba and John Cena in some time. It coincides with husband Nick also going on tour with the Jonas Brothers in the UK as well. Priyanka's next film, Love Again, premieres in May. Sam Heughan, Celine Dion and Russell Tovey are part of the cast, with Nick making a cameo too.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

                            "summary": "Actor Priyanka Chopra is in a mood to shake things up, and inspire some course correction. Having made her debut in the Hindi film industry in 2002, Priyanka went on to emerge as one of the biggest female stars of the generation. That is, until she felt ‘cornered’ in Bollywood and decided to pursue a career in the West, as she claimed in a recent interview.Her recent revelations, that she faced opposition in the Hindi film industry as people stopped casting her in movies, forcing her to eventually go to the West, reignited conversations around the functioning of the film industry — its politics, nepotistic nature, gatekeeping attitude and cliques.In an interview with indianexpress.com, Priyanka Chopra opened up about ways to make Bollywood a safe space for outsiders, who don’t come with a safety net of a film family. The actor, who is currently awaiting the release of her mega Prima Video series Citadel, said change starts with dismantling internal politics which often dictate casting in movies.“I think having conversations around opportunity and merit is important. Now that we are living in the world of streaming, there is so much more. The Hindi film industry has changed so much in the last five to ten years. You have so many talent – writers, directors, actors that come from outside the industry. When I first started, that was not the case, at all. So I think having conversations around the fact that the workplace should be merit based, that the workplace should be a positive environment, that casting should be a casting director’s job instead of the politics and the drama,” the actor said.View this post on Instagram A post shared by Priyanka (@priyankachopra)Priyanka Chopra, who moved to the US and bagged projects like the TV series Quantico (2015) and feature films including Dwayne Johnson starrer Baywatch and The Matrix Resurrections, said for the industry to be a safe workspace, opportunities should only rely on merit, not favoritism. Today, Priyanka notes, if there is a strong influx of outsiders in the industry, it is because her generation of actors “fought for it”.“I think having those conversations is really, really important so that there are no camps that actually rule casting and it is done because of merit and because of audiences wanting to watch people. I am so excited to be able to see so many new faces from outside (of the film industry) and different parts of the country who have come in to mainstream Hindi language entertainment. It gives me such a joy, to be able to see that in my own career. And that happened because my generation of actors fought for it,” she added.Earlier, speaking with Dax Shepherd on his podcast Armchair Expert, Priyanka had shared that she was feeling “cornered” in Bollywood and also had some “beef” with people in the industry. There were no names, but the claims were damaging, where Priyanka had said she was “not good at playing that game” and was tired of the “politics”.Advertisement“I was being pushed into a corner in the industry (Bollywood). I had people not casting me, I had beef with people, I am not good at playing that game so I kind of was tired of the politics and I said I needed a break. This music thing gave me an opportunity to go into another part of the world, not crave for the movies I didn’t want to get but I would require to schmooze certain clubs and cliques of people. It would require groveling and I had worked a long time by then that I didn’t feel like I wanted to do it,” she had said in the interview.Citadel features Priyanka Chopra as an elite spy Nadia Sinh opposite Game of Thrones star Richard Madden, who stars as Mason Kane in the globe-trotting series. It is produced by the Russo Brothers’ (filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo) AGBO and showrunner David Weil. The ambitious spy drama is slated to debut on April 28."

In a conversation with ETimes, Priyanka revealed if her character will crossover with the desi agents at some point in the show. In true super-spy style, Priyanka teased, Maybe, maybe not.She further added, But I think all the shows so far, the Italian show and the Indian show and our show, are, as a story, connected with each other. So the more you watch the shows, the more layers you'll peel away.This Prime Video series also marks PeeCee's first show release since becoming a mother to her beautiful baby girl, Malti Marie. It will see her taking on the role of Nadia, a strong self-made agent who works her way up the ranks to become one of Citadel's top spies. At a time when there is a dearth of such powerful women characters on film, we asked Priyanka her thoughts on the way the Russo brothers handled her character.From the first time I met Joe and Anthony and Jennifer Salke, who's the head of Amazon Studios, the ambition was always to create a spy show where the female and the male are toe-to-toe, said Priyanka and explained their power-play, They are the best in the business, and then they also have chemistry, and to create this really convoluted, delicious, juicy world around them. So I think that Joe and Anthony and David Weill, who's our showrunner, write for Nadia really well, and I really enjoyed that very much. Because it's rare.'Citadel' premieres on April 28, with one episode rolling out weekly till the season finale on May 26."

The actor left a huge void not just for his family but also for the industry because one rarely sees actors like him. Fans on social media continue to remember the actor and talk about many of his performances. But, people will now get to see the actor on the big screen for one last time.His last film, ‘The Song Of Scorpion’ is set to release on April 28, which will mark the third death anniversary of Irrfan. The film is produced by Zeeshan Ahmad who says, “It is my honour that my name has been associated with this film as a co-producer and one of the presenter of the film. We are glad that Irrfan Khan's last onscreen appearance in a film is soon going to be released in cinemas across the country and his fans will get to see him one last time on the big screen. Trust me, Irrfan's character and performance in the film is going to leave you spellbound.Irrfan’s character in the film is that of a camel trader who falls in love with Nooran. She’s a tribal woman who is independent and learning the ancient healing art of scorpion-singing from her grandmother. According to a popular myth, if a scorpion bites someone, they will die unless a scorpion-singer sings her song and cures the person.‘The Song Of The Scorpions’ was premiered at Switzerland’s Locarno Film Festival. It also stars Waheeda Rehman and Shashank Arora in important roles. The film is directed by Anup Singh. The trailer will be out tomorrow."

And now, the time has come to witness his magic one last time on the big screen. Yes, there is one such film called The Song Of Scorpion which will be Irrfan's last theatrical release. The film features Irrfan in a role of a lifetime. A film which unfortunately couldn't get released when he was alive and which will now release on 28th April, on the eve of the 3rd death anniversary of Irrfan Khan.The Song Of Scorpions has been produced by A Feather Light Films and KNM Productions and it has been presented by Panorama Spotlight and 70 MM Talkies. Talking about the film, co-producer and owner of the 70 MM Zeeshan Ahmad says, It is my honour that my name has been associated with this film as a co-producer and one of the presenter of the film. We are glad that Irrfan Khan's last onscreen appearance in a film is soon going to be released in cinemas across the country and his fans will get to see him one last time on the big screen. Trust me, Irrfan's character and performance in the film is going to leave you spellbound.Interestingly, the film has a very interesting plot. Irfaan Khan's character Aadam is a camel trader who falls in love with Nooran. The Song Of Scorpions tells the story of Nooran who is a fiercely independent tribal woman who is learning the ancient healing art of scorpion-singing from her grandmother Zubeida. According to a popular myth, if a scorpion bites you, you will die unless a scorpion-singer sings her song and cures you.Remembering the greatness of Irrfan Khan, co-producer and presenter of the film Zeeshan Ahmad further adds, The cinematic world is never going to be same without Irrfan Khan. He not only elevated many Hindi films with his nuanced and magical performances but he also did many films in Hollywood and other industries too where his performances were greatly acknowledged and appreciated by everyone. He was an actor par excellence and one of his heartfelt and mesmerizing performances will be seen in The song Scorpions. Don't miss the chance of witnessing the magic of Irrfan Khan on the big screen for the one last time.Notably, The Song of Scorpions was premiered at Switzerland's Locarno Film Festival and was widely appreciated by the international audiences. The film has been written and directed by Anup Singh. Apart from Irrfan, the film also stars Golshifteh Farahani, Waheeda Rehmaan and Shashank Arora in pivotal roles and it is gearing up for the release at the end of this month.Also read: Athiya Shetty pens heartfelt birthday wish for husband KL Rahul, shares loved-up picsAlso read: Samantha Ruth Prabhu quotes an excerpt from Bhagavad Gita amidst Shaakuntalam's debacleLatest Bollywood News"

                            "summary": "Filmmaker Mani Ratnam is gearing up for the release of the second part in the Ponniyin Selvan franchise next week. He feels the only way to decide how much violence is too much violence in mainstream cinema is when the focus rests on creating the mood, while shooting such sequences, and not on the details of it. Also read: Aishwarya Rai reigns supreme once again as Nandini who seeks revenge from Cholas. Watch Ponniyin Selvan 2 trailer Mani Ratnam worked with Aishwarya Rai on Ponniyin Selvan.In the recent past, there’s been a lot of debate on the glorification of violence in Indian cinema. In Vetrimaaran’s Viduthalai: Part 1, which was released two weeks ago, the filmmaker was criticised by a section of the audience for his depiction of violence in the form of police brutality.Mani Ratnam, who has shot elaborate war sequences in Ponniyin Selvan 2, feels filmmakers should restrict themselves by focusing on creating mood than on the detail, when it comes to violence. The film features Jayam Ravi in the role of Arulmozhivarman, while Vikram, Karthi, Trisha and Aishwarya Rai are seen in other key roles.“When you’re telling the story to a child, you automatically know where to draw the line. But when you’re making a film for the mainstream audiences, and people of all age groups can walk in, you should focus on creating the mood. When you’re shooting war sequences, it has to be real. But at the same time you can’t fantasise it. You can’t make it unreal... The restriction that you (filmmaker) put yourself in is to create a mood, not the detail,” Mani Ratnam told Hindustan Times.Ponniyin Selvan 2 is gearing up for release on April 28. The first part told the story of the early life of Arulmozhivarman (Ponniyin Selvan), who would go on to become the Chola emperor Rajaraja I (947–1014). Ponniyin Selvan 2 went on to gross over ₹500 crore at the box office worldwide after being released in September 2022. In Tamil Nadu, PS1 went on to become the highest grossing Tamil film of all time after surpassing Kamal Haasan’s Vikram’s lifetime gross of ₹183 crore in the state.The film marked Aishwarya Rai’s comeback to Tamil cinema after a decade. Aishwarya was playing dual roles – Nandini and her mute mother Mandakini Devi. Upon release, both audiences and critics were impressed with Aishwarya’s performance.ott:10"

                            "summary": "April 18, 2023 06:28 pm | Updated 06:39 pm ISTAfter the phenomenal success of Ponniyin Selvan 1, the Cholas are back for the sequel. With stakes higher than ever, the team promises that there’s a lot in store with Ponniyin Selvan 2, set to be released on April 28.Right now, Mani Ratnam’s cast of A-listers is travelling across the country to promote PS: 2. In Chennai, we catch up with them as they promote the conclusion to the epic saga.ALSO READ: ‘Ponniyin Selvan: 1’ movie review: Epic story gets Mani Ratnam’s royal treatmentJayam Ravi (Arunmozhi Varman AKA Ponniyin Selvan):PS 1 had a lot of character introductions and every 15 minutes, there was something new happening; that sort of screenplay was exciting. In PS 2, it’ll be like the climax from the get-go. After PS 1 was released, based on the comments it received, improvements have been made to the sequel; this film will be an upgraded version for sure.In PS 1, despite being a prince, my character would sport regular attire or that of a mahout as he is in hiding. The second part is a rebirth of sorts to him and his return to Thanjai to the brilliant ‘Veera Raja Veera’ track will be a highlight.The response to the project has been incredible. We heard that elderly people with oxygen cylinders and walking sticks visited theatres after ages to watch PS. Theatre owners called me and said that some audience members turned up with tiffin boxes, not knowing that it has been years since theatres allowed outside food! We have even heard stories of theatre owners requesting repeat audiences to allow the ones who haven’t seen the film to watch it once.Trisha (Kundavai):PS is a story that longed to be made into a film right from the days of MGR. I’m glad I got to be a part of it and it’s nice to be the face of Kundavai. The first part was a character introduction for the whole cast. While the romance portions in PS 1 were restricted to speaking with our eyes and a sense of flirtation, in PS 2 there will be more romance and it’ll be evident that Kundavai and Vandiyadevan like each other.I’m a Chennai ponnu and I grew up watching Mani sir’s films. So we don’t even think about how a woman character in his film would be; you just know how it is. We go in blind and follow everything Mani sir said, but he also made sure we had a few months of prep time which gave us the space to process the character. This made things much easier on the sets. After a film like this, there’s obviously pressure as to what we’re doing next. It also motivates us to be careful with the type of films we’ll choose hereafter.Karthi (Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan):The novel has all sorts of genres; right from romance and suspense yo action and history, and this was the reason it was such a challenge to adapt Kalki’s work. While making it into a film, it should reach the masses who haven’t read the books, as well as satisfy the ones who’ve read them.My mom rarely does an appreciation call, but she called and told me the film was fantastic. I was worried about how my wife would take in the fact that my character is known for his flirtations, but she was also happy with how dignified the character was.As far as PS 2 is concerned, the film will be interesting to even those who’ve read the novels. Vandiyadevan once again meets Nandini and Kundavai while they are alone in PS 2, and the situation is different from their earlier visits. So my character needed correction as to how he would talk and react.My dad often says that just like how every grain of rice has the name of the person consuming it, every frame has the name of the actor performing in it. I got to play a role that has crossed many actors over the years and I have given it my best. It’s nice to hear many people say now that they can’t see anyone else in that role but me.ALSO READ: On the ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ trail: Travellers explore Tamil Nadu in newer waysVikram Prabhu (Parthibendran Pallavan):For us, both the films feel like just one project; we have already spoken so much about it, but it still feels new at the same time. The character I played, Parthibendran Pallavan, will be seen more in PS 2 and he’s a part of many crucial scenes. Being a part of such a project is truly unforgettable.Sobhita Dhulipala (Vaanathi):Ponniyin Selvan has been my first film in Tamil and there was a lot of curiosity and excitement as to how my character would be received. I had great fun as my role is dramatically different from what I’ve done earlier, and it was really a privilege and pleasure. I believe all of us have different shades in us, and in cinema, we rarely get to showcase them all. Thanks to well-written characters and screenplay, this film gave us the space to perform.Director Mani Ratnam:Kalki had written such well-defined characters in his novel; they’re neither just black nor just white, they have all the shades. As we had such defined characters and actors who were ready to prepare and do homework, it was easier. It was a lot of content to condense into two films, so you try to take the basic elements and put them in an order where it peaks at one point and leads to another. I think the books were also split in that manner.Karikalan’s portion might be less in the novel but references to him are very strong and I believe that is the fulcrum of PS. In the written format, characters talking about a person can be mentioned easily... but as a film, we have to show it.Since we shot both films together, we didn’t have to drastically change much in the sequel. PS 1 is an introduction, PS 2 is the actual film, and we are confident that the sequel will shine more than the first part. When doing a film, that alone is my obsession and though there are many books on Ponniyin Selvan, I didn’t read them.The film is releasing on April 28 and from the next day, I’ll read any book I’m recommended (laughs). Also, the film is not the same without AR Rahman. While we have narrated the film through scenes, he has parallelly narrated the story through music. He knows where to underline, pause, lift and convert emotion into music.There will be more long-form content in Tamil going forward. There is a different rhythm to it; I’ve been used to a certain form for years now from which it is difficult to come out, but such formats are liberating for a storyteller. We don’t have to restrict ourselves to just making a two-and-a-half-hour film and that’s fantastic.Ponniyin Selvan 2 will be releasing theatrically on April 28"

                            "summary": "With the release of Ponniyin Selvan 2, all the pieces of Mani Ratnam’s magnum opus will come together, said acclaimed actor Vikram on Tuesday.The actor, who plays Aditha Karikalan in the pan-India film, said the team didn’t think the first part of the historical fiction drama, based on Kalki Krishnamurthy’s 1955 Tamil novel of the same name, will break “all records in south”. What they knew was that it would be received well as it was true to the Tamil culture.“We are very confident (about part two). The (part one of the) film was loved in Tamil because it was very true to what was written all those years ago. And they loved that. So there was no misinterpretation. We didn’t change anything. The second part that we are doing now, there are certain endings that we are leaving open,” Vikram told reporters here.The two-part Ponniyin Selvan chronicles the story of the early days of Arulmozhivarman (Jayam Ravi), one of the most powerful kings in the south, who went on to become the great Chola emperor Rajaraja Chola I.Ponniyin Selvan I was praised for its aesthetic value and layered characters and was reported as the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2022.Vikram said the whole cast would be ready to reprise their roles if Mani Ratnam ever makes a third part.“If Mani sir asks us to come back for Ponniyin Selvan 3, we’ll all be there,” he added.AdvertisementThe actor also spoke about why the movie perhaps did better in the south than in the Hindi-speaking belt.“Whenever we are releasing the film we never go with ‘Will this work?’ You think it’s going to work, no matter how bad the film is from anybody’s point of view. The kind of response we got for part one, we weren’t surprised. We didn’t think that it would break all records in south or Tamil Nadu, especially, but we knew it was going to do well… Second part is what everybody would want to see,” Vikram added.The actor was speaking at a press conference ahead of the film’s release on April 28. He was accompanied by co-stars Ravi, Karthi, Trisha Krishnan, Aishwarya Lekshmi and Sobhita Dhulipala.AdvertisementKarthi, who plays Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan in the film franchise, also elaborated on his recent comments during the film’s promotions where he said audiences in the north found Ponniyin Selvan I difficult to follow.“It’s only from the feedback I received from my friends here. And then I had to explain the story to them and sent them the WhatsApp forwards of the simple gist of the story. It was just a paragraph and after that they were able to follow and it became easier,” said the actor.The second part of Ponniyin Selvan offers a “recap” of the first installment to the viewers which will make it “easier to follow” the story, he added.“The faces are also familiar, so you don’t have to remember the names. You know who’s where and what they are doing. PS 2 is going to be much much easier to follow. PS 1 has done enough to set up PS 2 to go bigger,” Karthi said.The confusion, Vikram said, was perhaps to do with names more than anything else. Even he had a tough time remembering the names of the characters during the dubbing process.Advertisement“Like I couldn’t get some of the names I was saying right. Dubbing used to be a torture for me. I couldn’t get the names, so I could imagine… they all sound alike… It must be like Chinese for you.“Most of you are not familiar with us on the Hindi screen, but like I said, after watching the first part there shouldn’t be any confusion. There’s a recap and Amazon (Prime Video – where the first part is streaming) can always help you,” he added.AdvertisementJayam Ravi said playing the title role was a “big responsibility”.“Down south, this is an epitome of a character. They look at him as God, the ruler of the rulers, that’s why Rajaraja means ‘king of kings’. Mani sir called me and said ‘I don’t worry about other characters…’ what he meant was ‘I can handle every other character, but (in) this you have to bring something. You go and live as Rajaraja Chola for six months,” he added.AdvertisementAfter a lot of soul searching, the actor said, he found there were some similarities between him and the real Ponniyin Selvan.“One day, I came and he asked ‘Did you come up with something?’ I said ‘Sir, Ponniyin Selvan had a brother and a sister. I too have a brother and a sister. I don’t think in the thousand odd years the emotion of a brother to a sister has changed. Mother’s love for a son never changed. Humanity has taken the core of emotions intact all through the years, so I just had to replicate them properly,” said Ravi.While the men fight all the wars in the Ponniyin Selvan films, it is the women who run the show in the palace trying to keep the kingdom intact.Trisha said the second chapter of the franchise will see women rule in all their glory.“Part one was an introduction of every character. Part two is when the story actually begins. If you think the women were very powerful and empowered in part one, it will be a notch above in part two,” the actor, who plays Kundavai, said. Through Ponniyin Selvan, Sobhita said the team got an opportunity to champion female characters. The films mark her foray into Tamil cinema.“We had the chance to show the strength and grit of a woman under pressure with grace, which happens a lot in real life,” the actor, who plays Vaanathi, said.During the promotions, the stars also talked about losing the verified blue ticks on Twitter. Ravi and Trisha changed their names to their characters Arunmozhi Varman and Kundavai on the microblogging site, following which they lost their verification mark. “We were all supposed to change our names. Ravi and I, like over-enthusiastic people, did it first and lost the blue tick. We don’t know the reason behind it but the team is working on reviving it.“They are refusing to let us purchase it because we changed our names. We tried doing that as well this morning. It says suspicious activity because we changed our names,” Trisha said.“Hum abhi humare character verification mein hain. Baad mein name verification pe aayenge (We are working on our character verification, we will come to name verification later),” Ravi quipped.Also starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Prakash Raj, and Jayaram, Ponniyin Selvan 2 will be released worldwide in Tamil along with the dubbed versions in Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam."
